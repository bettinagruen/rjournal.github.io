    abstract: '  Abstract Examining distributions of variables is the first step in
      the analysis of a clinical trial before            more specific modelling can
      begin. Reporting these results to stakeholders of the trial is an essential            part
      of a statistician’s work. The atable package facilitates these steps by offering
      easy-to-use but still            flexible functions.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The tourr package in R has several algorithms and displays
      for showing multivariate data as            a sequence of low-dimensional projections.
      It can display as a movie but has no capacity for interaction,            such
      as stop/go, change tour type, drop/add variables. The tourrGui package provides
      these sorts            of controls, but the interface is programmed with the
      dated RGtk2 package. This work explores            using custom messages to
      pass data from R to D3 for viewing, using the Shiny framework. This is an            approach
      that can be generally used for creating all sorts of interactive graphics.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Record linkage aims at quickly and accurately identifying
      if two records represent the same            real world entity. In many applications,
      we are interested in restricting the linkage results to "1 to 1"            links,
      that is a single record does not appear more than once in the output. This can
      be dealt with the            transport algorithm. The optimization problem,
      however, grows quadratically in the size of the input,            quickly becoming
      untreatable for cases with a few thousand records. This paper compares different            solutions,
      provided by some R packages for linear programming solvers. The comparison is
      done            in terms of memory usage and execution time. The aim is to overcome
      the current implementation            in the toolkit RELAIS, specifically developed
      for record linkage problems. The results highlight            improvements beyond
      expectations. In fact the tested solutions allow successfully executing the
      "1 to            1" reduction for large size datasets up to the largest sample
      surveys at National Statistical Institutes.'

    bibauthor: Charlotte Dion and Simone Hermann and Adeline Samson
    abstract: '  Abstract Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are useful to model
      continuous stochastic processes.            When (independent) repeated temporal
      data are available, variability between the trajectories can be            modeled
      by introducing random effects in the drift of the SDEs. These models are useful
      to analyze            neuronal data, crack length data, pharmacokinetics, financial
      data, to cite some applications among            other. The R package focuses
      on the estimation of SDEs with linear random effects in the drift. The goal            is
      to estimate the common density of the random effects from repeated discrete
      observations of the            SDE. The package mixedsde proposes three estimation
      methods: a Bayesian parametric, a frequentist            parametric and a frequentist
      nonparametric method. The three procedures are described as well as the            main
      functions of the package. Illustrations are presented on simulated and real
      data.'

    abstract: '  Abstract Methods based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
      fingerprinting are in the            forefront among several techniques being
      proposed for indoor positioning. This paper introduces            the R package
      ipft, which provides algorithms and utility functions for indoor positioning
      using            fingerprinting techniques. These functions are designed for
      manipulation of RSSI fingerprint data            sets, estimation of positions,
      comparison of the performance of different positioning models, and            graphical
      visualization of data. Well-known machine learning algorithms are implemented
      in this            package to perform analysis and estimations over RSSI data
      sets. The paper provides a description            of these algorithms and functions,
      as well as examples of its use with real data. The ipft package            provides

    abstract: '  Abstract Gaussian stochastic process (GaSP) emulation is a powerful
      tool for approximating compu           tationally intensive computer models.
      However, estimation of parameters in the GaSP emulator is            a challenging
      task. No closed-form estimator is available and many numerical problems arise
      with            standard estimates, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator.
      In this package, we implement a marginal            posterior mode estimator,
      for special priors and parameterizations. This estimation method that            meets
      the robust parameter estimation criteria was discussed in Gu et al. (2018);
      mathematical reasons            are provided therein to explain why robust parameter
      estimation can greatly improve predictive            performance of the emulator.
      In addition, inert inputs (inputs that almost have no effect on the            variability
      of a function) can be identified from the marginal posterior mode estimation
      at no extra            computational cost. The package also implements the parallel
      partial Gaussian stochastic process            (PP GaSP) emulator (Gu and Berger
      (2016)) for the scenario where the computer model has multiple            outputs
      on, for example, spatial-temporal coordinates. The package can be operated in
      a default mode,            but also allows numerous user specifications, such
      as the capability of specifying trend functions and            noise terms.
      Examples are studied herein to highlight the performance of the package in terms
      of            out-of-sample prediction.'

    abstract: 'Intensive longitudinal data in the behavioral sciences are
      often noisy, multivariate in nature, and may involve multiple units
      undergoing regime switches by showing discontinuities interspersed
      with continuous dynamics. Despite increasing interest in using linear and nonlinear            differential/difference
      equation models with regime switches, there has been a scarcity of software            packages
      that are fast and freely accessible. We have created an R package called dynr
      that can handle            a broad class of linear and nonlinear discreteand
      continuous-time models, with regime-switching            properties and linear
      Gaussian measurement functions, in C, while maintaining simple and easy-to           learn
      model specification functions in R. We present the mathematical and computational
      bases used            by the dynr R package, and present two illustrative examples
      to demonstrate the unique features of            dynr.'

    abstract: ' Abstract Fuzzy clustering methods discover fuzzy partitions where
      observations can be softly assigned           to more than one cluster. The
      package fclust is a toolbox for fuzzy clustering in the R programming           language.
      It not only implements the widely used fuzzy k-means (FkM) algorithm, but also
      many FkM           variants. Fuzzy cluster similarity measures, cluster validity
      indices and cluster visualization tools           are also offered. In the current
      version, all the functions are rewritten in the C++ language allowing           their
      application in large-size problems. Moreover, new fuzzy relational clustering
      algorithms for           partitioning qualitative/mixed data are provided together
      with an improved version of the so-called           Gustafson-Kessel algorithm
      to avoid singularity in the cluster covariance matrices. Finally, it is now           possible
      to automatically select the number of clusters by means of the available fuzzy

    abstract: '  Abstract Matching is a well known technique to balance covariates
      distribution between treated and            control units in non-experimental
      studies. In many fields, clustered data are a very common occurrence            in
      the analysis of observational data and the clustering can add potentially interesting

    abstract: '  Abstract Identification of informative variables in an information
      system is often performed using            simple one-dimensional filtering
      procedures that discard information about interactions between            variables.
      Such an approach may result in removing some relevant variables from consideration.
      Here            we present an R package MDFS (MultiDimensional Feature Selection)
      that performs identification            of informative variables taking into
      account synergistic interactions between multiple descriptors            and
      the decision variable. MDFS is an implementation of an algorithm based on information
      theory            (Mnich and Rudnicki, 2017). The computational kernel of the
      package is implemented in C++. A            high-performance version implemented
      in CUDA C is also available. The application of MDFS is            demonstrated
      using the well-known Madelon dataset, in which a decision variable is generated
      from            synergistic interactions between descriptor variables. It is
      shown that the application of multidimen           sional analysis results in
      better sensitivity and ranking of importance.'

      third           order or Headrick’s fifth-order power method transformation.
      Simulation occurs at the component            level for continuous mixture distributions,
      and the target correlation matrix is specified in terms of            correlations
      with components. However, the package contains functions to approximate expected            correlations
      with continuous mixture variables. There are two simulation pathways which calculate            intermediate
      correlations involving count variables differently, increasing accuracy under
      a wide range            of parameters. The package also provides functions to
      calculate cumulants of continuous mixture            distributions, check parameter
      inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and summarize and            plot
      simulated variables. SimCorrMix is an important addition to existing R simulation
      packages            because it is the first to include continuous mixture and
      zero-inflated count variables in correlated            data sets.'

    title: Time-Series Clustering in R Using the dtwclust Package
    bibtitle: Time-Series Clustering in R Using the dtwclust Package
    author: Alexis Sardá-Espinosa
    bibauthor: Alexis Sardá-Espinosa
    abstract: '  Abstract Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably
      since their initial definition. The            common improvements are either
      related to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or            the
      function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception,
      with the Dynamic            Time Warping distance being particularly popular
      in that context. This distance is computationally            expensive, so many
      related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single            clustering
      algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies
      must be tested and            compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous.
      In this manuscript, a general overview            of shape-based time-series
      clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time            Warping
      and associated techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package
      for the R            statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can
      be used to evaluate many different time-series            clustering procedures.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces the shadow package for R. The package
      provides functions for shadow           related calculations in the urban environment,
      namely shadow height, shadow footprint and Sky            View Factor (SVF)
      calculations, as well as a wrapper function to estimate solar radiation while
      taking            shadow effects into account. All functions operate on a layer
      of polygons with a height attribute,            also known as “extruded polygons”
      or 2.5D vector data. Such data are associated with accuracy            limitations
      in representing urban environments. However, unlike 3D models, polygonal layers
      of            building outlines along with their height are abundantly available
      and their processing does not            require specialized closed-source 3D
      software. The present package thus brings spatio-temporal            shadow,
      SVF and solar radiation calculation capabilities to the open-source spatial
      analysis workflow            in R. Package functionality is demonstrated using
      small reproducible examples for each function.            Wider potential use
      cases include urban environment applications such as evaluation of micro-climatic            influence
      for urban planning, studying urban climatic comfort and estimating photovoltaic

    abstract: '  Abstract High-throughput genomic technologies bring to light a comprehensive
      hallmark of molecular            changes of a disease. It is increasingly evident
      that genes are not isolated from each other and the            identification
      of a gene signature can only partially elucidate the de-regulated biological
      functions in a            disease. The comprehension of how groups of genes
      (pathways) are related to each other (pathway           cross talk) could explain
      biological mechanisms causing diseases. Biological pathways are important            tools
      to identify gene interactions and decrease the large number of genes to be studied
      by partitioning            them into smaller groups. Furthermore, recent scientific
      studies have demonstrated that an integration            of pathways and networks,
      instead of a single component of the pathway or a single network, could            lead
      to a deeper understanding of the pathology.                StarBioTrek is an
      R package for the integration of biological pathways and networks which            provides
      a series of functions to support the user in their analyses. In particular,
      it implements            algorithms to identify pathways cross-talk networks

    abstract: '  Abstract We have created the R package ciuupi to compute confidence
      intervals that utilize uncertain            prior information in linear regression.
      Unlike post-model-selection confidence intervals, the confidence            interval
      that utilizes uncertain prior information (CIUUPI) implemented in this package
      has, to an            excellent approximation, coverage probability throughout
      the parameter space that is very close to            the desired minimum coverage
      probability. Furthermore, when the uncertain prior information is            correct,
      the CIUUPI is, on average, shorter than the standard confidence interval constructed
      using            the full linear regression model. In this paper we provide
      motivating examples of scenarios where            the CIUUPI may be used. We
      then give a detailed description of this interval and the numerical            constrained
      optimization method implemented in R to obtain it. Lastly, using a real data

    abstract: '  Abstract Though longitudinal data often contain missing responses
      and error-prone covariates,            relatively little work has been available
      to simultaneously correct for the effects of response missingness            and
      covariate measurement error on analysis of longitudinal data. Yi (2008) proposed
      a simulation            based marginal method to adjust for the bias induced
      by measurement error in covariates as well            as by missingness in response.
      The proposed method focuses on modeling the marginal mean and            variance
      structures, and the missing at random mechanism is assumed. Furthermore, the
      distribution            of covariates are left unspecified. These features make

      (BINned CORrelation) for            estimating the correlation between two unevenly
      spaced time series. This program is also applicable to            the situation
      of two evenly spaced time series not on the same time grid. BINCOR is based
      on a novel            estimation approach proposed by Mudelsee (2010) for estimating
      the correlation between two climate            time series with different timescales.
      The idea is that autocorrelation (e.g. an AR1 process) means            that
      memory enables values obtained on different time points to be correlated. Binned
      correlation            is performed by resampling the time series under study
      into time bins on a regular grid, assigning            the mean values of the
      variable under scrutiny within those bins. We present two examples of our            BINCOR

      inferences based on RSS and its modified versions.            For researchers,
      the RSSampling package provides a sample with RSS, extreme RSS, median RSS,            percentile
      RSS, balanced groups RSS, double versions of RSS, L-RSS, truncation-based RSS,
      and robust            extreme RSS when the judgment rankings are both perfect
      and imperfect. Researchers can also use            this new package to make
      parametric inferences for the population mean and the variance where the            sample
      is obtained via classical RSS. Moreover, this package includes applications
      of the nonparametric            methods which are one sample sign test, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon
      test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test            procedures. The package is available
      as RSSampling on CRAN.'

    abstract: '  Abstract                The unival package is designed to help researchers
      decide between unidimensional and correlated           factors solutions in
      the factor analysis of psychometric measures. The novelty of the approach is
      its use            of external information, in which multiple factor scores
      and general factor scores are related to relevant            external variables
      or criteria. The unival package’s implementation comes from a series of procedures            put
      forward by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2019) and new methodological developments
      proposed            in this article. We assess models fitted using unival by
      means of a simulation study extending the            results obtained in the
      original proposal. Its usefulness is also assessed through a real-world data            example.
      Based on these results, we conclude unival is a valuable tool for use in applications
      in which            the dimensionality of an item set is to be assessed.'
