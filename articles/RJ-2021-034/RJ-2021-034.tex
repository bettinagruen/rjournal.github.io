\abstract{%
The R package qcr for Statistical Quality Control (SQC) is introduced
and described. It includes a comprehensive set of univariate and
multivariate SQC tools that completes and increases the SQC techniques
available in R. Apart from integrating different R packages devoted to
SQC (qcc, MSQC), qcr provides nonparametric tools that are highly useful
when Gaussian assumption is not met. This package computes standard
univariate control charts for individual measurements, x̄, S, R, p, np,
c, u, EWMA, and CUSUM. In addition, it includes functions to perform
multivariate control charts such as Hotelling T2 , MEWMA and MCUSUM. As
representative features, multivariate nonparametric alternatives based
on data depth are implemented in this package: r, Q and S control
charts. The qcr library also estimates the most complete set of
capability indices from first to the fourth generation, covering the
nonparametric alternatives, and performing the corresponding capability
analysis graphical outputs, including the process capability plots.
Moreover, Phase I and II control charts for functional data are
included.
