@article{BroDutRoh19,
	Abstract = {Generalized linear models with categorical explanatory variables are considered and parameters of the model are estimated by an exact maximum likelihood method. The existence of a sequence of maximum likelihood estimators is discussed and considerations on possible link functions are proposed. A focus is then given on two particular positive distributions: the Pareto 1 distribution and the shifted log-normal distributions. Finally, the approach is illustrated on an actuarial dataset to model insurance losses.},

@article{ShiLou95,
	Abstract = {We investigate two-stage parametric and two-stage semi-parametric estimation procedures for the association parameter in copula models for bivariate survival data where censoring in either or both components is allowed. We derive asymptotic properties of the estimators and compare their performance by simulations. Both parametric and semi-parametric estimators of the association parameter are efficient at independence, and the parameter estimates in the margins have high efficiency and are robust to misspecification of dependency structures. In addition, we propose a consistent variance estimator for the semi-parametric estimator of the association parameter. We apply the proposed methods to an AIDS data set for illustration.},
