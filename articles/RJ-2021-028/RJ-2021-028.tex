\abstract{%
In this paper, we describe an R package named JMcmprsk, for joint
modelling of longitudinal and survival data with competing risks. The
package in its current version implements two joint models of
longitudinal and survival data proposed to handle competing risks
survival data together with continuous and ordinal longitudinal outcomes
respectively (Elashoff et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010). The corresponding
R implementations are further illustrated with real examples. The
package also provides simulation functions to simulate datasets for
joint modelling with continuous or ordinal outcomes under the competing
risks scenario, which provide useful tools to validate and evaluate new
joint modelling methods.
