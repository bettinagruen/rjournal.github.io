\abstract{%
Mixture cure models have been widely used to analyze survival data with
a cure fraction. They assume that a subgroup of the individuals under
study will never experience the event (cured subjects). So, the goal is
twofold: to study both the cure probability and the failure time of the
uncured individuals through a proper survival function (latency). The R
package npcure implements a completely nonparametric approach for
estimating these functions in mixture cure models, considering
right-censored survival times. Nonparametric estimators for the cure
probability and the latency as functions of a covariate are provided.
Bootstrap bandwidth selectors for the estimators are included. The
package also implements a nonparametric covariate significance test for
the cure probability, which can be applied with a continuous, discrete,
or qualitative covariate.
