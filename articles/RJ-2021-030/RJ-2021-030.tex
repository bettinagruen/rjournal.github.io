\title{Linear Regression with Stationary Errors: the R Package slm}
\author{by Emmanuel Caron, Jérôme Dedecker, and Bertrand Michel}

\maketitle

\abstract{%
This paper introduces the R package slm, which stands for Stationary
Linear Models. The package contains a set of statistical procedures for
linear regression in the general context where the error process is
strictly stationary with a short memory. We work in the setting of
Hannan (1973), who proved the asymptotic normality of the (normalized)
least squares estimators (LSE) under very mild conditions on the error
process. We propose different ways to estimate the asymptotic covariance
matrix of the LSE and then to correct the type I error rates of the
usual tests on the parameters (as well as confidence intervals). The
procedures are evaluated through different sets of simulations.
