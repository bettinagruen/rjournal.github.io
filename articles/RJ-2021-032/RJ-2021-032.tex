\abstract{%
In many situations, it could be interesting to ascertain whether groups
of curves can be performed, especially when confronted with a
considerable number of curves. This paper introduces an R package, known
as clustcurv, for determining clusters of curves with an automatic
selection of their number. The package can be used for determining
groups in multiple survival curves as well as for multiple regression
curves. Moreover, it can be used with large numbers of curves. An
illustration of the use of clustcurv is provided, using both real data
examples and artificial data. Keywords: multiple curves, number of
groups, nonparametric, survival analysis, regression models, cluster
