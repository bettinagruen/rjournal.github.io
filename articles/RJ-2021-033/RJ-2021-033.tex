\abstract{%
Several persistent homology software libraries have been implemented in
R. Specifically, the Dionysus, GUDHI, and Ripser libraries have been
wrapped by the TDA and TDAstats CRAN packages. These software represent
powerful analysis tools that are computationally expensive and, to our
knowledge, have not been formally benchmarked. Here, we analyze runtime
and memory growth for the 2 R packages and the 3 underlying libraries.
We find that datasets with less than 3 dimensions can be evaluated with
persistent homology fastest by the GUDHI library in the TDA package. For
higher-dimensional datasets, the Ripser library in the TDAstats package
is the fastest. Ripser and TDAstats are also the most memory-efficient
tools to calculate persistent homology.
