The R Journal  

Dear Professor Cook,

Please consider my article titled "Will the Real Hopkins Statistic Please Stand Up?" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript examines the way that Hopkins statistic for measuring spatial randomness of data has been defined in scientific publications. We found several different definitions and show via simulation studies which definition is correct.

We believe this paper is important to users of R because Hopkins statistic has previously been incorrectly implemented (following incorrect publications) in several R packages.  The manuscript and accompanying package "hopkins" aim to clarify how Hopkins statistic should be correctly calculated.

Best regards and thanks for your answers to my previous email questions!
