      "contents": "\nThe R Journal is the open access, refereed journal of the R project for statistical computing. It features short to medium length articles covering topics that should be of interest to users or developers of R.\nThe R Journal intends to reach a wide audience and have a thorough review process. Papers are expected to be reasonably short, clearly written, not too technical, and of course focused on R. Authors of refereed articles should take care to:\nput their contribution in context, in particular discuss related R functions or packages;\nexplain the motivation for their contribution;\nprovide code examples that are reproducible.\nFollowing revision of the content description of The R Journal, from January 2017 submitted articles may include:\nReviews and proposals: surveying and discussing challenges and opportunities of potential importance for the broader R community, including proposals and proof-of-concept implementations.\nComparisons and benchmarking: of implementations in base-R and contributed packages with each other, and where relevant with implementations in other software systems.\nApplications: demonstrating how new or existing techniques can be applied in an area of current interest using R, providing a fresh view of such analyses in R that is of benefit beyond the specific application.\nAdd-on packages: short introductions to contributed R packages that are already available on CRAN or Bioconductor, and going beyond package vignettes in aiming to provide broader context and to attract a wider readership than package users. Authors need to make a strong case for such introductions, based for example on novelty in implementation and use of R, or the introduction of new data structures representing general architectures that invite re-use.\nContinuing from R News, The R Journal also has a news section, including information on:\nChanges in R: new features of the latest release.\nChanges on CRAN: new add-on packages, manuals, binary distributions, mirrors,…\nUpcoming conferences: announcements of conferences related to R.\nConference reports: overviews of past conferences related to R.\n\n\n\n",

Do check that you are using at least version 0.13 of the LaTeX style file: RJournal.sty; the current version is contained in the zip archive of template files.\nInstructions for submitting\nNew submission\nTo submit a new article to the R Journal, please complete the form linked below. Note that journal policy changed in early 2017, and submissions of the “add-on packages” type will henceforth be subject to more rigorous scrutiny. If you are making a submission of this type, you should prepare a letter explaining how you meet our stronger requirements described prominently at the beginning of this website and in our Instructions for Authors.\nIf you have problems, first try to reduce the size of your submission zipfile as much as possible. If this does not help, please contact the Editor-in-Chief at r-journal@r-project.org.\nRe-submission or revision\nRe-submission and revisions to accepted articles are received through the same site where new submissions are received (link below). When providing a re-submission or revision, please enter the identifier of the original submission in the last field of the submission form below.\nClick here to submit an article, re-submission, or revision.\n\n\n\n",
