    "title": "spinifex: An R Package for Creating a Manual Tour of Low-dimensional Projections of Multivariate Data",
    "description": "Dynamic low-dimensional linear projections of multivariate\ndata collectively known as tours            provide an important tool for exploring\nmultivariate data and models. The R package tourr provides            functions\nfor several types of tours: grand, guided, little, local and frozen. Each of\nthese can be viewed            dynamically, or saved into a data object for\nanimation. This paper describes a new package, spinifex,            which provides\na manual tour of multivariate data where the projection coefficient of a single\nvariable            is controlled. The variable is rotated fully into the projection,\nor completely out of the projection. The            resulting sequence of projections\ncan be displayed as an animation, with functions from either the            plotly\nor gganimate packages. By varying the coefficient of a single variable, it is\npossible to explore            the sensitivity of structure in the projection\nto that variable. This is particularly useful when used            with a projection\npursuit guided tour to simplify and understand the solution. The use of the\nmanual            tour is applied particle physics data to illustrate the sensitivity\nof structure in a projection to specific            variable contributions.",
