# Instructions for authors

Please read the Instructions for Authors, which explains how to prepare an article for submission to The R Journal.

The following files provide the mandatory template for preparing an article for submission to the R Journal:

* LaTeX style file: `RJournal.sty`.
* fake Master LaTeX file: `RJwrapper.tex`.
* article template: `RJtemplate.tex` (including figure: `Rlogo-5.png` and bibliography: `RJreferences.bib`).
* example typeset template file: `RJwrapper_orig.pdf`.

Download [the zip archive of template files](https://rjournal.github.io/share/RJtemplate.zip) into a directory, run `tools::texi2pdf()` inside R a couple of times on `RJwrapper.tex` to produce a file `RJwrapper.pdf`, which shows how the template file would be typeset in an issue of The R Journal.

Submissions not using this template will be rejected without consideration. Do check that you are using at least version 0.13 of the LaTeX style file: RJournal.sty; the current version is contained in [the zip archive of template files](https://rjournal.github.io/share/RJtemplate.zip).

# Instructions for submitting

### New submission

To submit a new article to the R Journal, please complete the form linked below. Note that journal policy changed in early 2017, and submissions of the "add-on packages" type will henceforth be subject to more rigorous scrutiny. If you are making a submission of this type, you should prepare a letter explaining how you meet our [stronger requirements](https://journal.r-project.org/) described prominently at the beginning of this website and in our [Instructions for Authors](https://rjournal.github.io/share/author-guide.pdf).

If you have problems, first try to reduce the size of your submission zipfile as much as possible. If this does not help, please contact the Editor-in-Chief at <r-journal@r-project.org>.

### Re-submission or revision

Re-submission and revisions to accepted articles are received through the same site where new submissions are received (link below). When providing a re-submission or revision, please enter the identifier of the original submission in the last field of the submission form below.
