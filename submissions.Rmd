# Submitting PDF-style articles

Articles written for a PDF output format are still being accepted, however we
are now encouraging authors to try writing articles with R Markdown using the
[rjtools](rjournal.github.io/rjtools/) package. Using this package allows for
submissions suitable for both interactive online articles and static PDF copies.

You can find the current submission guidelines for PDF-only (non-rmarkdown)
articles here: <https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/>

# Submitting HTML-style articles

These instructions are actively being worked on, so please reach out if you have
questions or issues. You can get started with an article using the 
`rjtools::create_article()` function. This function provides a template that
demonstrates the expected structure of R Journal articles in an R Markdown 
format.

If you currently use the `rticles::rjournal_article` output format for R 
Markdown, you should be simply able to change output formats to 
`rjtools::rjournal_web_article` to preview the web format of your article.
Existing guidelines for referring to CRAN packages with `\CRANpkg{}` and other
macros should still work, however other LaTeX specific code will not.

When writing your article you should aim to write without specific reference to
HTML and LaTeX codes. If you do need to write code specific to the HTML or PDF
output, you can use `knitr::is_html_output()` and `knitr::is_latex_output()` to
conditionally produce a particular output.

The web articles for the R Journal are based on the [distill framework], which
provides several styling and arrangement options for your article contents.
The distill R package documentation (generally also applicable to articles 
written for the R Journal) describes how various article elements can be used:

We are especially looking for creative uses of interactive content in articles, 
however please aim to keep the file sizes of articles minimal.

# Instructions for submitting

### New submission

To submit a new article to the R Journal, please complete the form linked below. Note that journal policy changed in early 2017, and submissions of the "add-on packages" type will henceforth be subject to more rigorous scrutiny. If you are making a submission of this type, you should prepare a letter explaining how you meet our [stronger requirements](https://journal.r-project.org/) described prominently at the beginning of this website and in our [Instructions for Authors](https://rjournal.github.io/share/author-guide.pdf).

If you have problems, first try to reduce the size of your submission zipfile as much as possible. If this does not help, please contact the Editor-in-Chief at <r-journal@r-project.org>.

### Re-submission or revision

Re-submission and revisions to accepted articles are received through the same site where new submissions are received (link below). When providing a re-submission or revision, please enter the identifier of the original submission in the last field of the submission form below.
