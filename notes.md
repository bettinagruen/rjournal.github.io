# R Journal discussion points

## Updates

0. Style/layout almost ready for June issue release
1. Buttons work
-- PDF to left, cite, then tweet. (email)
2. Abstract changes (article description no longer required, abstract is used where needed)
3. Fixed header line height issue
4. Made PDF article page more minimal
5. Widened issue page
6. Continued working on re-implementing article metadata to include more fields / info

## Questions

1. How should the issues page be styled? Should it appear like the articles listing? Can we remove some info like the complete bibliography?
-- Move complete issue to title section. Consider moving ToC to left float (would be nice to follow page).
2. How/where should 'special articles' be located? Should they be searchable under /articles listings?
-- Special articles, yes. conference reports, editorials, & news - no. Low priority for searching all conference reports.
3. Customisation to the listing style, should we indicate peer reviewed tags and directly link PDF in results?
-- Yes
4. Not yet happy with article buttons, how can they be improved?
-- A bit, but mostly happy where they are. Low priority
5. How and where should the adaption of the distill.pub template (and distill rpkg) be cited?
-- about but check LICENSE
6. Design and contents of the /about page.
-- Editorial board
-- distill copyrights and usage info
