    "contents": "\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 14 Issue 2 of the R Journal.\nFirst, some news about the journal board. Mark van der Loo has very kindly agreed to move from Associate Editor to Executive Editor to fill a temporary gap. One new Associate Editor, Kevin Burke, has recently joined the team.\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, and H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the rjtools package. In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.\nThere are also exciting new efforts in developing software to convert the legacy papers from latex to Rmarkdown, and hence create an html version to complement the pdf. Abhishek Ulayil, funded by the 2022 Google Summer of Code project, supervised by Heather Turner and Di Cook, with collaboration from Christophe Dervieux and Mitch O’Hara-Wild, has created the R package, texor, https://abhi-1u.github.io/texor/. It converts the legacy latex style into to the new Rmarkdown template, as would be given with the rjtools package. This package will be used to slowly, and steadily convert as many past articles into an html version.\nIf you are currently only a latex author, the texor package will get your paper into an Rmarkdown paper, doing the hard-work of the conversion. This is a good opportunity to get a head start on learning how to make reproducible documents. Reproducible documents keeps your code and results in the same place, and reduces the chance of getting them out of sync. Going forwards with the R Journal there will be a growing emphasis on receiving papers in Rmarkdown (and Quarto, at some point) format, because it is easier to test the code, and it makes the work more accessible to readers.\n1 In this issue\nNews from the CRAN, the R Foundation and the Forwards Taskforce are included in this issue. We also have a report from the Why R? Turkey 2022 conference.\nThis issue features 18 contributed research articles the majority of which relate to R packages\nfor modelling tasks.

This report rounds up activities of the taskforce during the first half of 2022.\nAccessibility\nAs another step towards improving the accessibility of the R Journal, Di Cook and Heather Turner are mentoring a Google Summer of Code student, Abhishek Ulayil, on the project Converting past R Journal articles to HTML. This project has benefited from regular input from Mitchell O’Hara Wild and Christophe Dervieux, authors of the rjtools package that provides the new HTML template for R Journal articles (O’Hara-Wild et al. 2022).\ns gwynn sturdevant and Jonathan Godfrey were part of an invited panel at JSM 2022 on Delivering Data Differently that explored alternatives to data visualisation.\nCommunity engagement\nThe community team have taken a number of actions to support the R community in Africa. A WhatsApp group has been set up for leaders of African R User Groups, to facilitate collaboration. Kevin O’Brien has been a Zoom host for several R User Groups, including the Botswana, Eswatini and Bulawayo groups. Zane Dax worked with the Accra R User Group on graphical design for advertising their meetups. Kevin O’Brien and Sam Toet helped to organize the first Francophone satRday, which featured a line up of African speakers.\nAnother focus has been the relaunch of RainbowR led by Ella Kaye and Zane Dax. Following a well-attended online meetup, the website was rebuilt, the Slack group opened to new members with a new code of conduct, and the Twitter account has been in active use. The group plan to have regular online meetups and to raise awareness of issues affecting the LGBTQ+ community through sharing relevant data sets for exploration and teaching.\nBeyond this, taskforce members continue to engage with a range of communities. Zane Dax contributed to an update of the Minorities in R (MiR) website. Yanina Bellini Saibene and Heather Turner joined the Building inclusive communities panel at the launch of the AsiaR community, to share their experience from working with different communities.\nConferences\nYanina Bellini Saibene assisted the useR! 2022 team on behalf of the R Foundation, to share expertise in the organization of virtual conferences and help incorporate good practices that encourage diverse participation. (The conference was originally planned to be hybrid, but moved to be completely online.) Such practices included adding representatives from different regions to the organizing team, securing funding to caption talks, accepting elevator pitches and tutorials in non-English languages, and adjusting the registration fees to the income group of each participant’s country of residence. Many of these practices were based on the work of the organizing team of useR! 2021 - that included Yanina and other Forwards members - who summarized their recommendations in the recent publication: “Ten simple rules to host an inclusive conference” (Joo et al. 2022).\nR Contribution\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal and Heather Turner organized a series of Collaboration Campfires with a goal to demystify the R development process and highlight ways that R programmers can contribute. The first two sessions explored R’s bug-tracking process and how R users can contribute to reviewing bugs. The second two sessions explored R’s process for localization and how to contribute to a translation team. The sessions attracted a diverse group of participants who engaged with the interactive activities, providing a foundation for further engagement.\nThe R Contribution working Group (RCWG) organized a Bug BBQ as a satellite to useR! 2022. Members of the RCWG prepared a number of open bugs in advance, for participants to look at in one or more of three organized online sessions. The event was supported by several R Core members and attended by both novice and experienced contributors. For experienced contributors the event provided a spur to work on open bugs, leading to progress on several issues. Meanwhile novice contributors contributed to the analysis of open bugs, under the guidance of experienced contributors. As the first event of its kind, the event showed promise as a way to engage the wider R community in contribution.\nSaranjeet Kaur Bhogal has been working on a new chapter for the R Development Guide on contributing translations, as part of the R project’s Google Summer of Docs project, with substantial contribution from Michael Chirico. Along with Ben Ubah, Michael is co-mentoring a Google Summer of Code student, Meet Bhatnagar, to create a dashboard to monitor the status of translations in R.\nChanges in Membership\nNew members\nWe welcome the following member to the taskforce:\nCommunity team: Ella Kaye (co-leader)\nPrevious members\nThe following members have stepped down:\nCommunity team: Richard Ngamita (co-leader)\nAccessibility team: Becca Wilson\nSurveys team: Anna Vasylytsya (co-leader)\nWe thank them for their contribution to the taskforce.\n\n\n\nR.

    "contents": "\n1 Motivation\nThe Why R? Turkey 2022 conference was a three-day online conference that was organized as a part of the Why R? Global conference series have been organized annually by the Why R? Foundation since 2017. It is known as one of the largest annual R conferences in Europe (Burdukiewicz et al. 2018, 2019). In addition to the main conference, pre-meetings are held in different cities from all over the world. One of these pre-meetings was organized with the invited speakers in Turkey in 2020. This online event was the first R conference in Turkey. In addition, as a result of the positive feedback received from the participants, the theme of the Why R? Turkey 2021 conference was determined immediately. Thereafter, the second R conference was organized in 2021 with invited speakers (Cavus et al. 2021). The main objective was to bring Turkish R users together from all over the world, the second conference attracted a lot of attention with over 2000 registered participants.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The logo of Why R? Turkey 2022 Conference\n\n\n\nThe main limitation of the conference in 2021 was that it consisted of invited speakers only. Upon the feedback from the participants, the conference structure was changed into having regular talks, lightning talks. In addition, the conference also had a practical side with workshops for both beginners and more experienced R users. In this way, the conference turned into a more participant-friendly format. The following subsections are summarizing the planning phase and the content of the events.\n2 Planning\nAfter comparing several alternatives, it was decided to continue with Zoom (zoom.us) with one main account and six admins as the main platform for all events.\nA mailing tool called MailChimp, which also has on admin account, was used to establish seamless communication with the scientific committee and all other participants in the organization.\nParticipation certificates for attendees, speakers, workshop tutors and panelists were prepared and delivered by using the Sertifier platform (sertifier.com/tr/) at the end of the conference.\nNumerous academic publishing houses were investigated for publishing proceeding book with E-ISBN and it was decided to work with Nobel Publication House. The electronic version of the proceeding book was provided by the international publishing house.\nWorkshops\nFive workshops (\\(\\sim 1.5\\) hour-long sessions), from beginner level to advanced level were organized. Three of the workshops were held in Turkish and two in English. Thus, it was ensured that participants from all over the world would benefit from them. Detailed contents provided by the tutors for the workshops. Each each workshop was recorded with the consent of the tutor and after the conference videos were published on Youtube. Details and Youtube links for each workshop can be found below.\nIntroduction to R Programming by Ahmet Uraz Akgül (Turkish):\nR programming language is increasing its popularity day by day, including our country, and it has found use in almost every discipline. Being a free software, it has started to reach more people with its access to open source codes and the opportunities it offers. In such an environment, knowing the R programming language provides serious advantages. In the competitive software world, R can survive as a language worth learning; it may even be the language we use most often.\nData Visualization with R by İnan Utku Türkmen and Cansu Hürses (Turkish):\nAs part of the data visualization workshop with R, we will cover basic visualization issues with the ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) package, which is one of the most popular data visualization tools in the field of data science. Using this package we will practice how to create basic static chart types. We will see with examples how a chart can be customized by adding a title, specifying axis names, coloring according to certain categories, marking a specific region on the chart, and taking a section. During the workshop, we will create the interactive graphic in the link below, which is one of the famous visualizations of the Gapminder foundation, using R packages step by step: https://www.gapminder.org/tag/map/.\nProcessing tabular data with tidyverse by İmran Kocabıyık (Turkish):\nMost of the data we use in practice are kept in tabular format. The purpose of use of these data, which are stored in databases and various types of files, may not always be analysis. For this reason, even if the data is kept in tabular form, it requires serious processing to model or analyze it. The dplyr (Wickham et al. 2022) and tidyr (Wickham and Girlich 2022) packages offer very simple and effective solutions for these processes.\nIntroduction to Bioconductor by Nitesh Turaga (English):\nThis talk is an overview of the Bioconductor project which develops, supports, and disseminates free open source software, in the R programming language, that facilitates rigorous and reproducible analysis of data from current and emerging biological assays. The Bioconductor project has a large footprint around the world both in industry and academic research. We’ll discuss the important aspects of project such as methods of contribution, programming paradigms - interoperability and data structure design, and differences to other projects to draw comparison. It will also include a brief introduction to essential genomics data structures that have been pillars to the Bioconductor ecosystem. We welcome participation as we are dedicated to building a diverse, collaborative, and welcoming community of developers and data scientists.\nDeep Learning using R by Krystian Zielinski (English):\nDeep Learning is certainly not a future of technologies that surround us on a daily basis. It’s too late – it’s already here. Just try to find a company that’s not willing to enhance its products with AI driven algorithms. The data is there already, and the trust barrier is shrinking. It’s to nobody’s surprise – if AI is used in very sensitive areas like banking, military or medicine, it can’t be that bad. Netflix’s recommendation algorithms, Google Lens, Self Driving cars – you name it, Deep Learning is used everywhere. Thanks to many popular frameworks, training Neural Network model has never been so easy. You can find tutorials online, and based on them solve many problems. But after some time, the question arises: „How does this even work?” – and you should really know the answer. In the workshops I’d like to show you how theory affects the practice. Based on many examples we will train DNN models, show its limits, check how parameters like e.g. activation function affect the training phase, suggest best practices in data preparation and DNN architecture, explain the model’s predictions. If you’re familiar with R – this workshop is suited for you! If you’re just starting with Deep Learning or already have some experience, come and join us - I bet you won’t regret it!\nShort Tutorials\nIn addition to the workshops, short tutorials on three topics were organized. This type of event was planned to focus on more specific topics in longer duration than a regular talk. (\\(\\sim 30\\) mins each) Each workshop was recorded with the consent of the tutor and after the conference videos were published on Youtube. Details and Youtube links for each workshop can be found below.\nSpatial Analysis with R by Fırat Gündem (Turkish):\nOpen Data Portal applications of local governments both in America and Europe added a serious spatial dimension to data. The spatial dimension in question covers a wide area, from storing data in a way that includes spatial information (shape file, GeoJSON, etc.) to spatial data visualizations and analysis with spatial statistics and spatial econometric methods. The R program is constantly being renewed and expanded to include all spatial analysis techniques in the literature. Although there are many people who do spatial analysis with package programs such as ArcGIS, which are expensive and require personal licenses, RStudio allows to perform all spatial analyzes easily and free of charge with the libraries it contains. In this short study, all the basic steps of spatial analysis will be performed using a set of R libraries. For this, real spatial data from Turkey (GDP per capita on a provincial basis, etc.) will be used. Then, spatial data projection (sf, sp), neighborhood matrix creation and manipulation (rgdal), spatial data visualization and static and dynamic mapping ggplot2 (Wickham 2016), tmap (Tennekes 2018), leaflet (Cheng et al. 2021), three-dimensional mapping rayshader (Morgan-Wall 2021), spatial statistics rgeoda (Li and Anselin 2022) in RStudio. and spatial econometric models will be introduced practically using the relevant R libraries. Thus, all necessary tools for spatial data science will be introduced in R and the use of R will be encouraged with user-friendly applications.\nThe R Application for Physics-Informed Neural Networks by Melih Ağraz (Turkish):\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is a deep learning framework designed to solve nonlinear differential equations using artificial neural networks, published in 2019. Simple deep feed-forward neural network architectures and automatic differentiation method are used to solve differential equations in PINNs method. The PINNs method was first developed with Python Tensorflow. In this study, we will show how the solution of the equation \\(y'-y=0\\) for \\(y(0)=1\\), \\(y(1)=e\\) is solved by using reticulate (Ushey et al. 2021) library in R, with the help of PINNs method. This study is thought to find application area of PINNs method for R users as well. For this reason, a simple differential equation solution example such as \\(y' - y = 0\\) is preferred.\nServerless R in the Cloud - Deploying R into Production with AWS and Docker by İsmail Tigrek (English):\nThis tutorial will walk through deploying R code, machine learning models, or Shiny applications in the cloud environment. With this knowledge, you will be able to take any local R-based project you’ve built on your machine or at your company and deploy it into production on AWS using modern serverless and microservices architectures. In order to do this, you will learn how to properly containerize R code using Docker, allowing you to create reproducible environments. You will also learn how to set up event-based and time-based triggers. We will build out a real example that reads in live data, processes it, and writes it into a data lake, all in the cloud.\nPanels\nThe panels were planned based on the sharing experience in an interactive environment, where the participants could come together with experts in different domains. Biostatistics and R Education were selected as major topics in these events. The links to the video recordings and detailed content of the panels are given below:\nBiostatistics and Applications in R moderated by Prof. Dr. Ergun Karaağaoğlu (Turkish):\nProf. Dr. Recai Yücel (Temple University), Prof. Dr. Mithat Gönen (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center), and Dr. Anıl Dolgun (CSL Limited) attended as the panelists. In this panel, current research studies on biostatistics and the importance of using R in this domain were discussed. In addition, information about how career development was positively affected by using R was shared by the panelists with the audience. Thus, it was ensured that the participants were informed about the importance of the R in this field.\nR Education moderated by Olgun Aydin (Turkish):\nThe main topic of the panel was how to teach R in academia. Prof. Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel (Duke University), Dr. Mine Doğucu (University of California), and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Kübra Kabasakal (Hacettepe University) attended as the panelists. The panelists shared their approach in terms of teaching R in different fields of academic stuides. Moreoever, the panelists shared examples from their teaching materials with the audience.\n3 Participants\nThe \\(1366\\) participants were registered for the conference: \\(70\\%\\) of the participants were students and the rest were professionals who work for governmental institutions, companies from the private sector, and as academicians. The \\(43\\%\\) of the students are undergraduates, \\(26\\%\\) of them master studies and the \\(31\\%\\) are Ph.D. students.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The percentage of the degree of the participant students by years\n\n\n\nWhen the channels that the participants heard about the conference are examined, surprisingly, the percentage of participants who registered for the conference “on recommendation” was quite high (\\(26\\%\\)), in addition to the social media channels (LinkedIn - \\(30\\%\\), Twitter - \\(26\\%\\), and Instagram - \\(12\\%\\)) of which usage has increased in recent years.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: How did the participants hear about the conference?\n\n\n\nIn the registration form, questions about participants’ level of R knowledge and motivation of participants’ to take part in Why R? Turkey 2022 were included to deeply analyze profile of the participants. The \\(69\\%\\) of the participants stated that they had taken or attended a course related to R before. They evaluated their R programming language usage levels as shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that \\(90\\%\\) of them did not attend a conference about R before. In this respect, the conference was held with an audience suitable for the purpose of expanding usage of R. The areas of their interest are Data Visualization, Statistical Modeling, Big Data, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, respectively. The events planned for Why R? Turkey 2022 that motivated them register the conference are respectively: Scientific Sessions (\\(40\\%\\)), Workshops (\\(35\\%\\)) and Panels (\\(26\\%\\)).\n4 Evaluation\nAn evaluation questionnaire was conducted after the event to measure the satisfaction with the conference and to collect suggestions future organizations (Cordoba et al. 2019). The satisfaction part of the questionnaire consists of two questions: (1) general satisfaction and (2) the interaction level between the presenters and the listeners. The results of the questionnaire are quite positive in terms of the answer of the respondents. On a scale of \\(0-5\\), the mean of the satisfaction score is \\(4.74\\) with \\(0.46\\) standard deviation. Besides that, the mean of the interaction score is \\(4.50\\) with \\(0.69\\) standard deviation.\nThe second part of the questionnaire consists of the questions related to the motivation of the respondents regarding attendance and being a presenter for the next edition of the conference. According to the responses, although nearly all of the respondents (\\(99\\%\\)) plan to attend the conference in the next years, \\(30\\%\\) aim to participate to as a presenter.\nThe last part of the questionnaire is about the suggestions from the respondents. The suggestions generally focus on increasing the duration of regular talks and workshops. In addition, among the speakers, the higher number of private sector employees and the mention of sector or freelance job opportunities were among the most prominent suggestions. Respondents strongly mentioned that next events, which has been held online for two years, should be held face-to-face in the coming years to increase its effectiveness.\n5 Summary\nWhy R? Turkey 2022, as the next edition of Why R? Turkey 2021 conference, was the first R conference with call for papers held in Turkey. This conference aimed to encourage researchers and professionals, who are R users and developers, to share their work with a wider audience. This conference was organized as a user-friendly conference, taking into account the feedback received in the previous year’s version. In addition to scientific sessions, workshops, short tutorials, and panels were organized to broaden the content of the event. According to the evaluation survey made right after the conference, the participants stated that they were very satisfied and they would like to participate as a presenter to Why R conferences in the upcoming years. This finding demonstrates that the organisers of the conference succeeded the goals.\n6 Organizers\nThe Organizing Committee of Why R? Turkey 2022 consisted of eight Turkish researchers from three different countries: Turkey, Poland, and United Kingdom. It consisted of Mustafa Cavus (Warsaw University of Technology, Eskisehir Technical University), Olgun Aydin (Gdansk University of Technology, Why R? Foundation), Filiz Karadag (Ege University), Ugur Dar (Eskisehir Technical University), Ozan Evkaya (University of Edinburgh), Derya Turfan (Hacettepe University), Ozancan Ozdemir, Deniz Bezer (Middle East Technical University).\n7 Acknowledgement\nAs an organization committee, we would like to thank for his suggestions and support during the preparation part of the conference, for designing our graphics, and , for their guidance in general and also organizing the some of the panels and workshops. Moreover, we would like to thank the sponsors that support the Why R?

    "contents": "\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 14 Issue 1 of the R Journal. This\nissue heralds a switch from two issues per year to four and is my first as Editor-in-Chief. The change to four issues per year is in response to the increase in published articles in recent years. As articles will appear more speedily\nin a published issue, we will no longer list pdfs for Accepted articles on The R Journal website.\nFirst, some news about the journal board. Dianne Cook has stepped down as Editor-in-Chief but continues as an Executive Editor. In her time as EIC she provided excellent leadership and brought in many advances, most notably the change to the new modern journal format. One new Associate Editor, Simone Blomberg, has recently joined the team. We have a new, slimmed-down Editorial advisory board consisting of Henrik Bengtssen, Gabriela de Quiroz, Michael Kane and Rececca Killick. The board will provide continuity across changes in the editorial board, offering advice and acting as an independent body to handle issues of academic integrity.\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, and H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the rjtools package. In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.\n1 In this issue\nNews from the CRAN and the R Foundation are included in this issue.\nThis issue features 22 contributed research articles the majority of which relate to R packages\nfor modelling tasks.

    "contents": "\nForwards is an R Foundation taskforce working to widen the participation of under-represented groups in the R project and in related activities, such as the useR! conference. This report rounds up activities of the taskforce during the second half of 2022.\nAccessibility\nSince a number of people have joined the taskforce with a particular interest in accessibility, we have established a new Accessibility Team, led by s gwynn sturdevant and Jonathan Godfrey. The team will address accessibility to R and the R ecosystem in a broad sense, considering barriers faced by people with disabilities, or working in situations with limited internet access, or working in a language other than English, to name some of the major issues.\nAt their inaugural meeting in November, the team focused on improving documentation and reference materials for screen-reader users and those who prefer reading electronic documents in dark mode. Both issues are best handled by creating documents in HTML format. Di Cook shared a development version of The R Journal’s new HTML format, which was welcomed enthusiastically by the group and there was agreement to work together on testing and improving the journal’s accessibility.\nThe work of the new team is a continuation of the work Forwards has done on accessibility in the past, primarily in the context of the useR! conference. For 2021, Forwards members supported the organizers in their efforts to ensure that presentation materials and conference tools were accessible. Further detail is given in the blog posts Making Accessible Presentations at useR! 2021: The Story Behind the Scenes and How to Improve Conference Accessibility for Screen-reader Users - An Interview with Liz Hare. Liz Hare has been working on a joint project with Silvia Canelón as part of the MiR community, promoting good accessibility practices in data visualisation, a project that received funding from Code for Science and Society.\nCommunity engagement\nThe community team had a reboot in November, with Richard Ngamita stepping up to join Kevin O’Brien as co-lead. The team plans to focus on fostering networks in regions where the R community is less well connected, in particular supporting the work of AfricaR and the new AsiaR community, which has established a Slack Workspace and plans to hold regional online meetups in 2022.\nA key form of support is to encourage knowledge-sharing between regions, for example, by nominating speakers from Africa or Asia for speaking opportunities, or by joining events as a guest speaker. In recent months, Forwards members Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel spoke at satRday Nairobi, Heather Turner spoke at the 1st anniversary of R-Ladies Nairobi, and Kevin O’Brien spoke at the 3rd anniversary of Accra R User Ghana.\nSeveral members of the Community team are part of the R-Consortium Diversity & Inclusion Working Group, led by Samantha Toet. This group is currently working on four big projects: a guide to writing a code of conduct; an event organizer checklist; a speaker directory, and a speaker nomination form for R Consortium-affiliated events.\nConferences Team\nThe conferences team also gained a new lead, Yanina Bellini Saibene, who has been involved in the organization of many R events and conferences. Along with Natalia da Silva and Riva Quiroga, she chaired the LatinR 2021 conference, which took place online in November. Being online helped them to reach a record 1000 registrants. Highlights of the program included several papers from Spain, a full panel in Portuguese, and a full panel of Latin American women package developers. This is a great advance from the initial R Foundation endorsed event in 2018, which was a satellite to the 47 JAIIO informatics conference, attended by 50 people.\nIn collaboration with Claudia Alejandra Huaylla from the Surveys team, Yanina Bellini Saibene reflected in a blog post on the Latin American Community at useR! 2021, describing an exceptional increase in participation compared to previous years. They identify many practices that facilitated this growth, starting with including Latin American R users in the organizing team.\nSeveral members of Forwards have been involved in the Google Season of Docs project to develop a knowledgebase and information board to support the organization of useR! conferences. In particular, Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (co-lead of the Surveys team) and Noa Tamir (co-lead of the Conferences team) were hired as writers on the project and they made sure that diversity and inclusion were considered throughout the documentation. The project built on a lot of previous work by Forwards, including the annual surveys conducted at useR! and pieces of documentation written by the Conferences team as part of their work to make useR! more inclusive. Forwards will continue to be involved in maintaining these resources, which have already gained attention from the organizers of other R conferences.\nOn-ramps Team\nThe Forwards first-contributions repository walks people through making a simple pull request on GitHub, a useful skill for contributing to R packages and other open source software. Zane Dax updated the README with instructions in Spanish in time for Hacktoberfest 2021, which encourages people to make four quality pull requests to public GitHub and/or GitLab repositories during October.\nThe R Contribution Working Group held an Ideas Incubator over the summer to generate new ideas to work on during 2021/2022. One issue prioritised for attention was improving communications. This led to further development of the R Contribution Site, which is now hosted at https://contributor.r-project.org/ and linked from the main R Project website. The group has also set up the @R_Contributors Twitter account, for sharing event announcements and other news. The current focus is to run some outreach events related to the R Development Guide. Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal and Heather Turner are leading this project, which is supported by a grant from Code for Science and Society, as part of the Digital Infrastructure Incubator. The idea is that these events will provide an on-ramp into a larger contributor event to run in parallel with useR! 2022.\nPackage Development Modules\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Emma Rand ran a “train-the-trainer” event in November/December aimed at R-Ladies leaders and others who wanted to use the Forwards package development teaching materials with their user groups. Attendees are starting to plan workshops based on the materials: a course was run in early January 2022 by R-Ladies NYC (lead by Joyce Robbins, assisted by Erin Grand and Emily Dodwell) and a course is currently underway by R-Ladies Remote (lead by Heather Turner and Rita Giordano).\nChanges in Membership\nNew members\nWe welcome the following members to the taskforce:\nConferences team: Yanina Bellini Saibene (co-leader)\nSurveys team: Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (co-leader)\nPrevious members\nThe following members have stepped down:\nCommunity team: Madlene Hamilton, Ileena Mitra\nOn-ramps team: Jenny Bryan (co-leader)\nSocial media team: Lorna Maria Aine (co-leader), Shakirah Nakalungi (co-leader), Wenfeng Qin\nSurveys team: David Meza\nTeaching team: Yizhe Xu\nWe thank them for their contribution to the taskforce. We also acknowledge the work of Emily Dodwell, who has stepped down as administrator after serving for several years (remaining a member of the Teaching team) – s gwynn sturdevant has taken on this role.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 13 Issue 1 of the R Journal.\nFirst, some news about the journal board. Welcome to Gavin Simpson, who joins as a new Executive Editor! In addition, welcome to our new Associate Editors Nicholas Tierney, Isabella Gollini, Rasmus Bth, Mark van der Loo, Elizabeth Sweeney, Louis Aslett and Katarina Domijan. With the large volume of submissions, the Associate Editors now play a vital role in processing articles.\nThere are some new developments in the journal operations under way. We are working on a new package rjtools which will operate a little like the devtools package and help you to create a new article from a template, and check that it conforms to the style and requirements of the R Journal.\nWe are also working on supporting articles written in RMarkdown, which will be rendered in html through a modified distill web site. The exciting feature is that interactive graphics could be included directly in the article. You can see how this current issue would look in the new style at rjournal.r-project.org/dev. Particularly, look at articles Conversations in Time by Wang and Cook as an example that has two examples of how interactive graphics might be included. Other articles rendered in html are “Finding Optimal Normalizing Transformations” by Peterson, “Automating Reproducible, Collaborative\nClinical Trial Document Generation” by Kane, Jiang and Urbanek, and “Towards a Grammar for Processing Clinical Trial Data” by Kane. All remaining articles in the new site style are the current pdf style.\nTo experiment with creating a new article, or to check that your article, conforms with the R Journal author guidelines, go to https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/. Note that it is still ok to use the rticles package R Journal Rmarkdown template to create your article. This will generate the files that are compiled to pdf using latex, but it is an easy translation for us to convert them into the new style.\nThe operational support and the experiments have been supported with generous funding from the R Consortium (https://www.r-consortium.org).\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild has worked on infrastructure, the new article submission system, a new issue build system and now the new article delivery system providing html format. H. Sherry Zhang has taken over from Stephanie Kobakian, in developing the rjtools package including check functions for new articles to help authors get the style constraints correct. In addition, articles in this issue have been painstakingly copy edited by Dewi Amaliah.\n1 In this issue\nNews from the R Core, CRAN, Bioconductor, the R Foundation, and the foRwards Taskforce are included in this issue along with a summary of activities at the R Medicine and Why R? 2021 conferences.\nThis issue features 37 contributed research articles covering these topics:\nMultivariate analysis\nSeedCCA: An integrated R-package for Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares\nUnidimensional and Multidimensional Methods for Recurrence Quantification Analysis with crqa\nclustcurv: An R Package for Determining Groups in Multiple Curves\ngofCopula: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae\nROCnReg: An R Package for Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Inference With and Without Covariates\n\nNon-parametric methods\nnpcure: An R Package for Nonparametric Inference in Mixture Cure Models\nROBustness In Network (robin): an R package for Comparison and Validation of Communities\nkrippendorffsalpha: An R Package for Measuring Agreement Using Krippendorff’s Alpha Coefficient\n\nTemporal and longitudinal methods\nJMcmprsk: An R Package for Joint Modelling of Longitudinal and Survival Data with Competing Risks\nLinear Regression with Stationary Errors: the R Package slm\npenPHcure: Variable Selection in Proportional Hazards Cure Model with Time-Varying Covariates\npdynmc: A Package for Estimating Linear Dynamic Panel Data Models Based on Nonlinear Moment Conditions\nDChaos: An R Package for Chaotic Time Series Analysis\nIndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes\ngarchx: Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modelling\nWorking with CRSP/COMPUSTAT in R: Reproducible Empirical Asset Pricing\nAnalysing Dependence Between Point Processes in Time Using IndTestPP\nConversations in Time: Interactive Visualisation to Explore Structured Temporal Data\n\nComputing infrastructure\nA Method for Deriving Information from Running R Code\nWide-to-tall Data Reshaping Using Regular Expressions and the nc Package\nThe bdpar Package: Big Data Pipelining Architecture for R\nBenchmarking R packages for calculation of Persistent Homology\ndistr6: R6 Object-Oriented Probability Distributions Interface in R\nAutomating Reproducible, Collaborative Clinical Trial Document Generation\nReproducible Summary Tables with the gtsummary Package\nTowards a Grammar for Processing Clinical Trial Data\n\nSimulation and optimisation\nFinding Optimal Normalizing Transformations via bestNormalize\nPackage wsbackfit for Smooth Backfitting Estimation of Generalized Structured\nModels\nRLumCarlo: Simulating Cold Light using Monte Carlo Methods\nOneStep: Le Cam’s one-step estimation procedure\nThe HBV.IANIGLA Hydrological Model\nRegularized Transformation Models: The tramnet Package\n\nOther topics\nexPrior: An R Package for the Formulation of Ex-Situ Priors\nBayesSPsurv: An R Package to Estimate Bayesian (Spatial) Split-Population Survival Models\nStatistical Quality Control with the qcr Package\nThe R Package smicd: Statistical Methods for Interval-Censored Data\nstratamatch: Prognostic Score Stratification Using a Pilot Design\n\nHappy reading, and code testing!\n\n\n\n",
