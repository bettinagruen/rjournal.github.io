    "contents": "\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 14 Issue 1 of the R Journal. This\nissue heralds a switch from two issues per year to four and is my first as Editor-in-Chief. The change to four issues per year is in response to the increase in published articles in recent years. As articles will appear more speedily\nin a published issue, we will no longer list pdfs for Accepted articles on The R Journal website.\nFirst, some news about the journal board. Dianne Cook has stepped down as Editor-in-Chief but continues as an Executive Editor. In her time as EIC she provided excellent leadership and brought in many advances, most notably the change to the new modern journal format. One new Associate Editor, Simone Blomberg, has recently joined the team. We have a new, slimmed-down Editorial advisory board consisting of Henrik Bengtssen, Gabriela de Quiroz, Michael Kane and Rececca Killick. The board will provide continuity across changes in the editorial board, offering advice and acting as an independent body to handle issues of academic integrity.\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild continues to work on infrastructure, and H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the rjtools package. In addition, articles in this issue have been carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.\nIn this issue\nNews from the CRAN and the R Foundation are included in this issue.\nThis issue features 22 contributed research articles the majority of which relate to R packages\nfor modelling tasks. All packages are available on CRAN. Topics covered are:\nTemporal and longitudinal methods\ncpsurvsim: An R Package for Simulating Data from Change-Point Hazard Distributions\nThe smoots Package in R for Semiparametric Modeling of Trend Stationary Time Series\nstarvars: An R Package for Analysing Nonlinearities in Multivariate Time Series\nFMM: An R package for modeling rhythmic patterns on oscillatory systems\ntvReg: Time-varying Coefficients in Multi-Equation Regression in R\nPower and Sample Size for Longitudinal Models in R - The longpower Package and Shiny App\n\nEstimation and inference\ndglars A Software Tool For Sparse Estimation Of A General Class Of High-dimensional GLMs\nbayesanova: An R package for Bayesian inference in the analysis of variance via Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Gaussian mixture models\nRKHSMetaMod: An R package to estimate the Hoeffding decomposition of a complex model by solving RKHS ridge group sparse optimization problem\nPSweight: An R Package for PropensityScore Weighting Analysis\n\nMachine learning\nRFpredInterval: An R Package for Prediction Intervals with Random Forests and Boosted Forests\nfairmodels: A Flexible Tool For Bias Detection, Visualization, And Mitigation Graphics and Visualisation, Machine Learning & Statistical Learning\nspherepc: An R Package for Dimension Reduction on a Sphere\n\nOther topics\nblindrecalc: An R Package for Blinded Sample Size Recalculation\nrmonad: Pipelines you can compute on\netrm: Energy Trading and Risk Management in R\nfcaR, Formal Concept Analysis with R\nAdvancing reproducible research by publishing R markdown notebooks as interactive sandboxes using the learnr package\n\nApplications\nPalmer Archipelago Penguins Data in the palmerpenguins R Package - An Alternative to Anderson’s Irises\nA Computational Analysis of the Dynamics of R Style Based on 94 Million Lines of Code from All CRAN Packages in the Past 20 Years\nMeasuring the Extent and Patterns of Urban Shrinkage for Small Towns Using R\nRevisiting Historical Bar Graphics on Epidemics in the Era of R ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nForwards is an R Foundation taskforce working to widen the participation of under-represented groups in the R project and in related activities, such as the useR! conference. This report rounds up activities of the taskforce during the second half of 2022.\nAccessibility\nSince a number of people have joined the taskforce with a particular interest in accessibility, we have established a new Accessibility Team, led by s gwynn sturdevant and Jonathan Godfrey. The team will address accessibility to R and the R ecosystem in a broad sense, considering barriers faced by people with disabilities, or working in situations with limited internet access, or working in a language other than English, to name some of the major issues.\nAt their inaugural meeting in November, the team focused on improving documentation and reference materials for screen-reader users and those who prefer reading electronic documents in dark mode. Both issues are best handled by creating documents in HTML format. Di Cook shared a development version of The R Journal’s new HTML format, which was welcomed enthusiastically by the group and there was agreement to work together on testing and improving the journal’s accessibility.\nThe work of the new team is a continuation of the work Forwards has done on accessibility in the past, primarily in the context of the useR! conference. For 2021, Forwards members supported the organizers in their efforts to ensure that presentation materials and conference tools were accessible. Further detail is given in the blog posts Making Accessible Presentations at useR! 2021: The Story Behind the Scenes and How to Improve Conference Accessibility for Screen-reader Users - An Interview with Liz Hare. Liz Hare has been working on a joint project with Silvia Canelón as part of the MiR community, promoting good accessibility practices in data visualisation, a project that received funding from Code for Science and Society.\nCommunity engagement\nThe community team had a reboot in November, with Richard Ngamita stepping up to join Kevin O’Brien as co-lead. The team plans to focus on fostering networks in regions where the R community is less well connected, in particular supporting the work of AfricaR and the new AsiaR community, which has established a Slack Workspace and plans to hold regional online meetups in 2022.\nA key form of support is to encourage knowledge-sharing between regions, for example, by nominating speakers from Africa or Asia for speaking opportunities, or by joining events as a guest speaker. In recent months, Forwards members Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel spoke at satRday Nairobi, Heather Turner spoke at the 1st anniversary of R-Ladies Nairobi, and Kevin O’Brien spoke at the 3rd anniversary of Accra R User Ghana.\nSeveral members of the Community team are part of the R-Consortium Diversity & Inclusion Working Group, led by Samantha Toet. This group is currently working on four big projects: a guide to writing a code of conduct; an event organizer checklist; a speaker directory, and a speaker nomination form for R Consortium-affiliated events.\nConferences Team\nThe conferences team also gained a new lead, Yanina Bellini Saibene, who has been involved in the organization of many R events and conferences. Along with Natalia da Silva and Riva Quiroga, she chaired the LatinR 2021 conference, which took place online in November. Being online helped them to reach a record 1000 registrants. Highlights of the program included several papers from Spain, a full panel in Portuguese, and a full panel of Latin American women package developers. This is a great advance from the initial R Foundation endorsed event in 2018, which was a satellite to the 47 JAIIO informatics conference, attended by 50 people.\nIn collaboration with Claudia Alejandra Huaylla from the Surveys team, Yanina Bellini Saibene reflected in a blog post on the Latin American Community at useR! 2021, describing an exceptional increase in participation compared to previous years. They identify many practices that facilitated this growth, starting with including Latin American R users in the organizing team.\nSeveral members of Forwards have been involved in the Google Season of Docs project to develop a knowledgebase and information board to support the organization of useR! conferences. In particular, Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (co-lead of the Surveys team) and Noa Tamir (co-lead of the Conferences team) were hired as writers on the project and they made sure that diversity and inclusion were considered throughout the documentation. The project built on a lot of previous work by Forwards, including the annual surveys conducted at useR! and pieces of documentation written by the Conferences team as part of their work to make useR! more inclusive. Forwards will continue to be involved in maintaining these resources, which have already gained attention from the organizers of other R conferences.\nOn-ramps Team\nThe Forwards first-contributions repository walks people through making a simple pull request on GitHub, a useful skill for contributing to R packages and other open source software. Zane Dax updated the README with instructions in Spanish in time for Hacktoberfest 2021, which encourages people to make four quality pull requests to public GitHub and/or GitLab repositories during October.\nThe R Contribution Working Group held an Ideas Incubator over the summer to generate new ideas to work on during 2021/2022. One issue prioritised for attention was improving communications. This led to further development of the R Contribution Site, which is now hosted at https://contributor.r-project.org/ and linked from the main R Project website. The group has also set up the @R_Contributors Twitter account, for sharing event announcements and other news. The current focus is to run some outreach events related to the R Development Guide. Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal and Heather Turner are leading this project, which is supported by a grant from Code for Science and Society, as part of the Digital Infrastructure Incubator. The idea is that these events will provide an on-ramp into a larger contributor event to run in parallel with useR! 2022.\nPackage Development Modules\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Emma Rand ran a “train-the-trainer” event in November/December aimed at R-Ladies leaders and others who wanted to use the Forwards package development teaching materials with their user groups. Attendees are starting to plan workshops based on the materials: a course was run in early January 2022 by R-Ladies NYC (lead by Joyce Robbins, assisted by Erin Grand and Emily Dodwell) and a course is currently underway by R-Ladies Remote (lead by Heather Turner and Rita Giordano).\nChanges in Membership\nNew members\nWe welcome the following members to the taskforce:\nConferences team: Yanina Bellini Saibene (co-leader)\nSurveys team: Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (co-leader)\nPrevious members\nThe following members have stepped down:\nCommunity team: Madlene Hamilton, Ileena Mitra\nOn-ramps team: Jenny Bryan (co-leader)\nSocial media team: Lorna Maria Aine (co-leader), Shakirah Nakalungi (co-leader), Wenfeng Qin\nSurveys team: David Meza\nTeaching team: Yizhe Xu\nWe thank them for their contribution to the taskforce. We also acknowledge the work of Emily Dodwell, who has stepped down as administrator after serving for several years (remaining a member of the Teaching team) – s gwynn sturdevant has taken on this role.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\nOn behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 13 Issue 1 of the R Journal.\nFirst, some news about the journal board. Welcome to Gavin Simpson, who joins as a new Executive Editor! In addition, welcome to our new Associate Editors Nicholas Tierney, Isabella Gollini, Rasmus Bååth, Mark van der Loo, Elizabeth Sweeney, Louis Aslett and Katarina Domijan. With the large volume of submissions, the Associate Editors now play a vital role in processing articles.\nThere are some new developments in the journal operations under way. We are working on a new package rjtools which will operate a little like the devtools package and help you to create a new article from a template, and check that it conforms to the style and requirements of the R Journal.\nWe are also working on supporting articles written in RMarkdown, which will be rendered in html through a modified distill web site. The exciting feature is that interactive graphics could be included directly in the article. You can see how this current issue would look in the new style at https://rjournal.r-project.org/dev. Particularly, look at articles Conversations in Time by Wang and Cook as an example that has two examples of how interactive graphics might be included. Other articles rendered in html are “Finding Optimal Normalizing Transformations” by Peterson, “Automating Reproducible, Collaborative\nClinical Trial Document Generation” by Kane, Jiang and Urbanek, and “Towards a Grammar for Processing Clinical Trial Data” by Kane. All remaining articles in the new site style are the current pdf style.\nTo experiment with creating a new article, or to check that your article, conforms with the R Journal author guidelines, go to https://rjournal.github.io/rjtools/. Note that it is still ok to use the rticles package R Journal Rmarkdown template to create your article. This will generate the files that are compiled to pdf using latex, but it is an easy translation for us to convert them into the new style.\nThe operational support and the experiments have been supported with generous funding from the R Consortium (https://www.r-consortium.org).\nBehind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal operations and the new developments. Mitchell O’Hara-Wild has worked on infrastructure, the new article submission system, a new issue build system and now the new article delivery system providing html format. H. Sherry Zhang has taken over from Stephanie Kobakian, in developing the rjtools package including check functions for new articles to help authors get the style constraints correct. In addition, articles in this issue have been painstakingly copy edited by Dewi Amaliah.\nIn this issue\nNews from the R Core, CRAN, Bioconductor, the R Foundation, and the foRwards Taskforce are included in this issue along with a summary of activities at the R Medicine and Why R? 2021 conferences.\nThis issue features 37 contributed research articles covering these topics:\nMultivariate analysis\nSeedCCA: An integrated R-package for Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares\nUnidimensional and Multidimensional Methods for Recurrence Quantification Analysis with crqa\nclustcurv: An R Package for Determining Groups in Multiple Curves\ngofCopula: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae\nROCnReg: An R Package for Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve Inference With and Without Covariates\n\nNon-parametric methods\nnpcure: An R Package for Nonparametric Inference in Mixture Cure Models\nROBustness In Network (robin): an R package for Comparison and Validation of Communities\nkrippendorffsalpha: An R Package for Measuring Agreement Using Krippendorff’s Alpha Coefficient\n\nTemporal and longitudinal methods\nJMcmprsk: An R Package for Joint Modelling of Longitudinal and Survival Data with Competing Risks\nLinear Regression with Stationary Errors: the R Package slm\npenPHcure: Variable Selection in Proportional Hazards Cure Model with Time-Varying Covariates\npdynmc: A Package for Estimating Linear Dynamic Panel Data Models Based on Nonlinear Moment Conditions\nDChaos: An R Package for Chaotic Time Series Analysis\nIndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes\ngarchx: Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modelling\nWorking with CRSP/COMPUSTAT in R: Reproducible Empirical Asset Pricing\nAnalysing Dependence Between Point Processes in Time Using IndTestPP\nConversations in Time: Interactive Visualisation to Explore Structured Temporal Data\n\nComputing infrastructure\nA Method for Deriving Information from Running R Code\nWide-to-tall Data Reshaping Using Regular Expressions and the nc Package\nThe bdpar Package: Big Data Pipelining Architecture for R\nBenchmarking R packages for calculation of Persistent Homology\ndistr6: R6 Object-Oriented Probability Distributions Interface in R\nAutomating Reproducible, Collaborative Clinical Trial Document Generation\nReproducible Summary Tables with the gtsummary Package\nTowards a Grammar for Processing Clinical Trial Data\n\nSimulation and optimisation\nFinding Optimal Normalizing Transformations via bestNormalize\nPackage wsbackfit for Smooth Backfitting Estimation of Generalized Structured\nModels\nRLumCarlo: Simulating Cold Light using Monte Carlo Methods\nOneStep: Le Cam’s one-step estimation procedure\nThe Hydrological Model\nRegularized Transformation Models: The tramnet Package\n\nOther topics\nexPrior: An R Package for the Formulation of Ex-Situ Priors\nBayesSPsurv: An R Package to Estimate Bayesian (Spatial) Split-Population Survival Models\nStatistical Quality Control with the qcr Package\nThe R Package smicd: Statistical Methods for Interval-Censored Data\nstratamatch: Prognostic Score Stratification Using a Pilot Design\n\nHappy reading, and code testing!\n\n\n\n",

The group includes a mix of statisticians and physicians who use R regularly in their work, as well as members from RStudio and the R Foundation.\nThe 2018 inaugural R/Medicine conference was a two day event held near Yale University with Rob Tibshirani providing the initial keynote address; each day began with a two hour tutorial. In 2019 the conference was held in Boston and included, among others, keynote addresses by Terry Therneau and Frank Harrell. Two half-day workshops were held on the day prior to the conference.\nIn 2020, the R/Medicine Working Group organized the third annual R/Medicine conference which was originally planned to be held in Philadelphia. By early April 2020 it was clear that the conference would need to be held virtually. This article describes some of the challenges as well as unexpected benefits we encountered when pivoting to a virtual conference, with the hope of providing useful information for other conference organizers.\nConference Planning and Logistics\nInitial planning for the conference began in January 2020. By February, we had\nidentified keynote speakers and workshop leaders, and started negotiations with a hotel near\nthe Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia which was\npegged as the site of the conference.\nHowever, by the beginning of April we\nrealized that we would need to switch to a virtual event.\nThe initial\nchallenge for the planning committee was identifying\ntechnology that would allow us to run a main session of presentations,\nteach short courses, and host Birds-of-a-Feather (BoF)\nactivities that allow like-minded R users to network and socialize. Because of our limited budget we had\nlimited choices for an online conferencing platform. With help from the\nLinux Foundation, which provided recommendations of some of the available conference\nplatforms, we chose to use Crowdcast (https://www.crowdcast.io).\nThis tool was simple to\nuse for the attendees and the organizers, had a green room to line up\nspeakers, an interactive chat feature, and the ability to automatically provide a recording of the session\nfor replay immediately after its conclusion. Compared to other conference platforms, Crowdcast has a rather minimalist set of features. However, feedback from conference participants confirmed\nthat the user interface, consisting of a single-track video feed and sidebar participant chat worked well. One downside of Crowdcast was that it did not support screen readers or closed captioning.\nFor the short courses we chose Zoom (https://zoom.us) as the delivery platform, primarily because of its widespread use and because of a mature breakout room functionality. We found that breakout rooms are a useful tool for teaching, but should be used sparingly, because the overhead of sending participants into breakout rooms can interrupt the flow of teaching the material. For the Introduction to R for Clinicians course, we had a meet-and-greet breakout near the beginning of the course as well as a final “Hackathon” breakout in which participants were able to team up to design a dashboard.\nOften, the most effective way to teach programming topics is live coding (Wilson 2019). Much effort has been devoted to create teaching environments that allow participants to live code during a short course without requiring installation of any software. In the R ecosystem, the most notable and laudable effort in this regard is RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud), which is based on the RStudio Server Integrated Development Environment (IDE). From previous experience teaching R to an audience of clinicians who have no programming experience and are unfamiliar with the R ecosystem, we knew that the RStudio Cloud environment could be challenging because it requires each participant to first register a personal account on the platform before being granted access to the training environment. To address this, we created a training environment with pre-configured generic sequentially numbered training accounts (e.g., train001, train002, etc.). After receiving training account credentials, a participant could directly access their training environment from a web browser without any further sign-ups. The training environment was implemented as a Docker-based web application based on RStudio Server which was configured with custom R packages and exercise files and hosted on a cloud provider. The application is available for free online (Kadauke 2020c).\nZoom was used for the BoF sessions, and we used Slack for back-channel communication\nbetween the organizers, participants, and presenters. Some Slack channels were created for participants while other channels were limited to the conference planners. After the conclusion of the conference, all the recorded presentations were loaded onto the\nR/Medicine 2020 YouTube channel which is hosted by the R Consortium -R/medicine 2020 YouTube channel (2020). Since\nSeptember 13, 2020 when the videos were uploaded, there have been over 3,200\nviews.\nRegistration and abstract submission were facilitated by infrastructure\nprovided by the Linux Foundation. Google Sheets were used to centralize\norganization of the program and the list of volunteers. We used Google Docs for creating conference planning documents and Google Forms for course sign-ups and surveys.\nSince the @r_medicine Twitter account has a large following (2,557 as of June 2021), we used Twitter as the main outlet to promote the event. We also directly engaged specific groups that we wanted to participate to improve the conference experience, including R/Ladies, Minorities in R, as well as medical professional organizations including the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC), and Mass Spectrometry & Advances in the Clinical Lab (MSACL).\nVolunteers\nThe number of volunteers needed for the virtual conference was significantly higher than for the previous in-person R/Medicine conferences. For each short course we had at least one teaching assistant for every 10 participants. Additionally, we had someone monitoring the Zoom chat to escalate issues when necessary.\nFor the main session we had two moderators who alternated between speakers in order to orient the upcoming speaker in the green room. We also had a Crowdcast host who helped behind the scenes and moved participants from one presentation to the next. One person was also in charge of playing any of the talks that were pre-recorded. Each BoF room had a facilitator. Because this was a virtual conference, we also identified back-up volunteers in case there were power outages or issues with internet access. Pre-conference training and discussion sessions were held for short course teaching assistants. Pre-conference technical checks were held prior to the conference for the speakers, instructors, and volunteers.\nThe Conference\nIn the previous two years, attendance at each conference was around 150 participants. In 2020, 587 people registered for the conference, including 225 students, 185 academics, 104 from industry, and 73 who were working on COVID-19 related projects. Of these, 32% were from outside the United States coming from 43 countries (Figure \\(\\ref{fig:map}\\)). Of those who registered, 452 attended at least some sessions live and 431 watched some sessions via the replay feature in Crowdcast. The main conference was held over two days and included 4 keynote addresses, 16 regular talks, 11 lightning talks, and one panel discussion. The schedule included three BoF time slots, each with 4-5 different topics.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Location of those who registered for the 2020 R/Medicine conference\n\n\n\nWe conducted a brief post-conference survey, which garnered 163 responses. We included the question “How likely are you to recommend this conference to a friend or colleague?” with a 1-5 scale. The “net promoter score”, which was calculated by subtracting the fraction of respondents rating the aforementioned question between 1-3 from the fraction of respondents rating it a 5, was 55%. Of all respondents, 98% indicated that they planned to attend R/Medicine in the future.\nShort Courses\nPre-conference events included two short courses presented on the day prior to the conference. The first course, Introduction to R for Clinicians, is an adaptation of the popular Welcome to the Tidyverse course (Grolemund 2019) for an audience of healthcare professionals and clinical researchers. The four-hour course placed heavy emphasis on reproducibility and using R Markdown as a computational document format and introduced fundamental concepts of data visualization and data transformation using the tidyverse set of tools (Wickham et al. 2019). Course materials (Kadauke 2020a) and recordings (Kadauke 2020b) are available online.\nThe second course, Introduction to Machine Learning with Tidymodels, was taught by Alison Hill and focused on the data scientist/statistician audience. This four-hour course aimed to provide a gentle introduction to machine learning with R using the modern suite of predictive modeling packages called tidymodels. Participants practiced building, evaluating, comparing, and tuning predictive models interactively. The course introduced fundamental concepts including resampling, overfitting, the holdout method, the bias-variance trade-off, ensembling, cross-validation, and feature engineering; the course materials (Hill 2020) is available online.\nAttendance at the short courses was limited by request of the instructors.\nThe Introduction to R for Clinicians class drew 143 participants, and 80\nattended the Introduction to Machine Learning with Tidymodels course. Course recordings were available for anyone registered for the conference.\nScientific Program\nWe received 43 abstracts and accepted 25. Additionally, we held space for late-breaking COVID-19 related presentations and for two sponsors. The Scientific Program of the conference was divided into six sessions, each covering a broad theme.\nR in Clinical Research/Clinical Trials:\nThis session started with a presentation by Daniela Witten, in which the keynote speaker presented a theoretical framework for re-using data that was collected for testing pre-specified hypotheses to drive new hypothesis generation. Additional sessions focused on analyzing and reporting clinical trial data as well as outlier and anomaly detection in clinical trial data sets.\nCollaboration/Reproducibility:\nThe second session started with a keynote by Robert Gentleman in which he outlined the value of large, well-curated data sets as well as how the R ecosystem will be essential for developing new treatments as well as validating and deploying healthcare analytics and clinical decision support tools. Additional talks discussed the {drake} and {holepunch} packages.\nNew analysis approaches and packages:\nThe last session of the first day started with a dazzling presentation by Travis Gerke and Garrick Aden-Buie in which the speakers discussed the development of internal R packages. An early prototype of a package for creating CONSORT diagrams was presented, as well as summaries of more mature packages including {gtsummary}, {nDSPA}, and {treeheatr}.\nR in Clinical Practice, Education, and Bioethics:\nThe first session of the second conference day started with a keynote speech by Ewen Harrison in which he highlighted the flexibility and ease of using R which makes it an ideal platform for clinician-researchers or other researchers who are not primarily programmers, as well as the collaborative nature of the R community. Additional presentations discussed the role of R in processing laboratory data in clinical practice as well as teaching R to healthcare professionals. Finally, a team presentation by Joy Payton and Paulette McRae highlighted the problematic history of racism in medical research and practice, discussed root causes of bias in data, and offered suggestions to mitigate these biases.\nDashboards and Shiny Apps:\nThis session discussed a variety of web applications developed using the Shiny framework that were being used either in clinical practice or clinical research.\nCOVID-19 research:\nThe final session started with a keynote by Patrick Mathias, who shared his experience directing both the clinical operations and operational analytics efforts of one of the busiest clinical COVID-19 testing laboratories in the United States (Greenwich 2020). Additional presentations highlighted the role R has played in coordinating the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLessons learned\nOverall, the conference succeeded well beyond our expectations. Some of the lessons we learned are as follows.\nThe chat feature helped build community and allowed active participation in the conference. For instance, some presenters tag-teamed where one person presented and another answered questions via chat as they arose. Other presenters had pre-recorded their talk and were thus able to answer live questions during the playback of their presentation.\nSlack was essential for the behind-the-scenes coordination, especially as issues arose. Additionally, we had participants create their own channels and Zoom sessions for further discussion on certain topics.\nHaving back-ups for all the major coordinating roles was essential. Fortunately we had limited issues, but one keynote speaker experienced a power outage, leading to an unavoidable delay.\nAlthough Crowdcast allows for smooth transitioning between speakers, time to transition between presenters needs to be built into the schedule, since presenters run over, technical issues emerge, and bio-breaks are important. It is also wise to build in some flex-time in case there are technical difficulties.\nDuring the presentations it was challenging to let speakers know when they were running out of time. All moderators downloaded a app to their phones that allowed them to play a doorbell sound to indicate to the speaker that their time is almost up, however that was not always effective. For 2021 we are planning to require that lightning talks be pre-recorded.\nHaving a virtual meeting greatly expanded our reach. In 2019 we held the conference in Boston and had roughly 150 attendees from a handful of countries whereas in 2020 we had 452 attendees from 43 countries. We hope that the larger attendance will increase our impact as well as our ability to obtain sponsors for future conferences.\nRecruitment for high caliber keynote speakers was perhaps easier because the time commitment and travel effort were substantially less than for an in-person conference.\nSponsors\nWe would like to thank all the sponsors that supported the 2020 conference: American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC), Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Association for Mass Spectrometry & Advances in the Clinical Lab (MSACL), Procogia, the R Consortium, RStudio, and Yale School of Public Health.\nAcknowledgements\nAs members of the R/Medicine 2020 Organizing and Programming Committees, we would like to thank all the volunteers who contributed to the success of the conference, the course instructors and teaching assistants, the keynote and contributed speakers, and all the attendees who dialed in from around the globe.\nLinks\nFurther information about R/Medicine 2020 and the contributions presented during the conference can be found at the conference website: https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/\n\n\n\nA.
