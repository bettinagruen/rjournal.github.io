\maketitle


On behalf of the editorial board, I am pleased to present Volume 14
Issue 2 of the R Journal.

First, some news about the journal board. Mark van der Loo has very
kindly agreed to move from Associate Editor to Executive Editor to fill
a temporary gap. One new Associate Editor, Kevin Burke, has recently
joined the team.

Behind the scenes, several people are assisting with the journal
operations and the new developments. Mitchell O'Hara-Wild continues to
work on infrastructure, and H. Sherry Zhang continues to develop the
\pkg{rjtools} package. In addition, articles in this issue have been
carefully copy edited by Hannah Comiskey.
