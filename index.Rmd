The R Journal is the open access, refereed journal of the R project for statistical computing. It features short to medium length articles covering topics that should be of interest to users or developers of R.

The R Journal intends to reach a wide audience and have a thorough review process. Papers are expected to be reasonably short, clearly written, not too technical, and of course focused on R. Authors of refereed articles should take care to:

* put their contribution in context, in particular discuss related R functions or packages;
* explain the motivation for their contribution;
* provide code examples that are reproducible.

Following revision of the content description of The R Journal, from January 2017 submitted articles may include:

**Reviews and proposals:**
surveying and discussing challenges and opportunities of potential importance for the broader R community, including proposals and proof-of-concept implementations.

**Comparisons and benchmarking:**
of implementations in base-R and contributed packages with each other, and where relevant with implementations in other software systems.

**Applications:**
demonstrating how new or existing techniques can be applied in an area of current interest using R, providing a fresh view of such analyses in R that is of benefit beyond the specific application.

**Add-on packages:**
short introductions to contributed R packages that are already available on CRAN or Bioconductor, and going beyond package vignettes in aiming to provide broader context and to attract a wider readership than package users. Authors need to make a strong case for such introductions, based for example on novelty in implementation and use of R, or the introduction of new data structures representing general architectures that invite re-use.

Continuing from [R News](http://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/index.html), The R Journal also has a news section, including information on:

**Changes in R:**
new features of the latest release.

**Changes on CRAN:**
new add-on packages, manuals, binary distributions, mirrors,...

**Upcoming conferences:**
announcements of conferences related to R.

**Conference reports:**
overviews of past conferences related to R.
