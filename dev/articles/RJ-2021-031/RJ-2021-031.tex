\maketitle

\abstract{%
The exPrior package implements a procedure for formulating informative
priors of geo statistical properties for a target field site, called
ex-situ priors and introduced in Cucchi et al.~(2019). The procedure
uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to assimilate multiple types of data
coming from multiple sites considered as similar to the target site.
This prior summarizes the information contained in the data in the form
of a probability density function that can be used to better inform
further geostatistical investigations at the site. The formulation of
the prior uses ex-situ data, where the data set can either be gathered
by the user or come in the form of a structured database. The package is
designed to be flexible in that regard. For illustration purposes and
for easiness of use, the package is ready to be used with the worldwide
hydrogeological parameter database (WWHYPDA) Comunian and Renard (2009).
