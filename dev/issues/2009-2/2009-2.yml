    Aspects of the Social Organization and Trajectory of the R
              Project
  author: John Fox
  bibauthor: John Fox
  landing: '2009'
  abstract: Based partly on interviews with members of the R Core team, this paper
    considers the development of the R Project in the context of open-source software
    development and, more generally, voluntary activities. The paper describes aspects
    of the social organization of the R Project, including the organization of the
    R Core team; describes the trajectory of the R Project; seeks to identify factors
    crucial to the success of R; and speculates about the prospects for R.

  abstract: Recursive partitioning methods are amongst the most popular and widely
    used statistical learning tools for nonparametric regression and classification.
    Especially random forests, that can deal with large numbers of predictor variables
    even in the presence of complex interactions, are being applied successfully in
    many scientific fields (see, e.g., ??, and the references therein for applications
    in genetics and social sciences). Thus, it is not surprising that there is a variety
    of recursive partitioning tools available in R (see http://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning
    for an overview).

    ConvergenceConcepts: An R Package to Investigate Various

  bibauthor: Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux and Benoit Liquet
  landing: '2009'
  abstract: 'ConvergenceConcepts is an R package, built upon the tkrplot, tcltk and
    lattice packages, designed to investigate the convergence of simulated sequences
    of random variables. Four classical modes of convergence may be studied, namely:
    almost sure convergence (a.s.), convergence in probability (P), convergence in
    law (L) and convergence in r-th mean (r). This investigation is performed through
    accurate graphical representations. This package may be used as a pedagogical
    tool. It may give students a better understanding of these notions and help them
    to visualize these difficult theoretical concepts. Moreover, some scholars could
    gain some insight into the behaviour of some random sequences they are interested
    in.'

  abstract: '  Abstract asympTest is an R package implementing large sample tests
    and confidence intervals. One            and two sample mean and variance tests
    (differences and ratios) are considered. The test statistics            are all
    expressed in the same form as the Student t-test, which facilitates their presentation
    in the            classroom. This contribution also fills the gap of a robust
    (to non-normality) alternative to the chi           square single variance test
    for large samples, since no such procedure is implemented in standard            statistical
    software.'

  abstract: This article describes the R package copas which is an add-on package
    to the R package meta. The R package copas can be used to fit the Copas selection
    model to adjust for bias in meta-analysis. A clinical example is used to illustrate
    fitting and interpreting the Copas selection model.

    Transitioning to R: Replicating SAS, Stata, and SUDAAN
              Analysis Techniques in Health Policy Data
  author: Anthony Damico
  bibauthor: Anthony Damico
  landing: '2009'
  abstract: Statistical, data manipulation, and presentation tools make R an ideal
    integrated package for research in the fields of health policy and healthcare
    management and evaluation. However, the technical documentation accompanying most
    data sets used by researchers in these fields does not include syntax examples
    for analysts to make the transition from another statistical package to R. This
    paper describes the steps required to import health policy data into R, to prepare
    that data for analysis using the two most common complex survey variance calculation
    techniques, and to produce the principal set of statistical estimates sought by
    health policy researchers. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
    Household Component (MEPS-HC), this paper outlines complex survey data analysis
    techniques in R, with side-by-side comparisons to the SAS, Stata, and SUDAAN statistical
    software packages.

  bibauthor: Graham J Williams
  landing: '2009'
  abstract: '  Abstract Data mining delivers insights, patterns, and descriptive and
    predictive models from the            large amounts of data available today in
    many organisations. The data miner draws heavily on            methodologies,
    techniques and algorithms from statistics, machine learning, and computer science.
    R            increasingly provides a powerful platform for data mining. However,
    scripting and programming            is sometimes a challenge for data analysts
    moving into data mining. The Rattle package provides a            graphical user
    interface specifically for data mining using R. It also provides a stepping stone
    toward            using R as a programming language for data analysis.'

  abstract: The sos package provides a means to quickly and flexibly search the help
    pages of contributed packages, finding functions and datasets in seconds or minutes
    that could not be found in hours or days by any other means we know. Its findFn
    function accesses Jonathan Baron’s R Site Search database and returns the matches
    in a data frame of class "findFn", which can be further manipulated by other sos
    functions to produce, for example, an Excel file that starts with a summary sheet
    that makes it relatively easy to prioritize alternative packages for further study.
    As such, it provides a very powerful way to do a literature search for functions
    and packages relevant to a particular topic of interest and could become virtually
    mandatory for authors of new packages or papers in publications such as The R
    Journal and the Journal of Statistical Software.
