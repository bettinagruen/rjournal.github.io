  abstract: '  Abstract Social scientists have long hand-labeled texts to create datasets
    useful for studying topics            from congressional policymaking to media
    reporting. Many social scientists have begun to incorporate            machine
    learning into their toolkits. RTextTools was designed to make machine learning
    accessible            by providing a start-to-finish product in less than 10 steps.
    After installing RTextTools, the initial            step is to generate a document
    term matrix. Second, a container object is created, which holds all            the
    objects needed for further analysis. Third, users can use up to nine algorithms
    to train their data.            Fourth, the data are classified. Fifth, the classification
    is summarized. Sixth, functions are available for            performance evaluation.
    Seventh, ensemble agreement is conducted. Eighth, users can cross-validate            their
    data. Finally, users write their data to a spreadsheet, allowing for further manual
    coding if            required.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Many problems in statistics, finance, biology, pharmacology,
    physics, mathematics, eco           nomics, and chemistry involve determination
    of the global minimum of multidimensional functions.            R packages for
    different stochastic methods such as genetic algorithms and differential evolution            have
    been developed and successfully used in the R community. Based on Tsallis statistics,
    the R            package GenSA was developed for generalized simulated annealing
    to process complicated non-linear            objective functions with a large
    number of local minima. In this paper we provide a brief introduction            to
    the R package and demonstrate its utility by solving a non-convex portfolio optimization
    problem            in finance and the Thomson problem in physics. GenSA is useful
    and can serve as a complementary            tool to, rather than a replacement
    for, other widely used R packages for optimization.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We present multiple factor analysis for contingency tables
    (MFACT) and its implementation            in the FactoMineR package. This method,
    through an option of the MFA function, allows us to deal            with multiple
    contingency or frequency tables, in addition to the categorical and quantitative
    multiple            tables already considered in previous versions of the package.
    Thanks to this revised function, either            a multiple contingency table
    or a mixed multiple table integrating quantitative, categorical and            frequency
    data can be tackled.                The FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008; Husson
    et al., 2011) offers the most commonly used            principal component methods:
    principal component analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA;            Benzécri,
    1973), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA; Lebart et al., 2006) and multiple
    factor            analysis (MFA; Escofier and Pagès, 2008). Detailed presentations
    of these methods enriched by            numerous examples can be consulted at
    the website http://factominer.free.fr/.                An extension of the MFA
    function that considers contingency or frequency tables as proposed by            Bécue-Bertaut
    and Pagès (2004, 2008) is detailed in this article.                First, an example
    is presented in order to motivate the approach. Next, the mortality data used            to
    illustrate the method are introduced. Then we briefly describe multiple factor
    analysis (MFA)            and present the principles of its extension to contingency
    tables. A real example on mortality data            illustrates the handling of
    the MFA function to analyse these multiple tables and, finally, conclusions            are
    presented.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Recent advances in computer recording and storing technology
    have tremendously increased            the presence of functional data, whose
    graphical representation can be infinite-dimensional curve,            image,
    or shape. When the same functional object is observed over a period of time, such
    data            are known as functional time series. This article makes first
    attempt to describe several techniques            (centered around functional
    principal component analysis) for modeling and forecasting functional            time
    series from a computational aspect, using a readily-available R addon package.
    These methods            are demonstrated using age-specific Australian fertility
    rate data from 1921 to 2006, and monthly sea            surface temperature data
    from January 1950 to December 2011.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Blind people have experienced access issues to many software
    applications since the advent            of the Windows operating system; statistical
    software has proven to follow the rule and not be an            exception. The
    ability to use R within minutes of download with next to no adaptation has opened            doors
    for accessible production of statistical analyses for this author (himself blind)
    and blind students            around the world. This article shows how little
    is required to make R the most accessible statistical            software available
    today. There is any number of ramifications that this opportunity creates for
    blind            students, especially in terms of their future research and employment
    prospects. There is potential            for making R even better for blind users.
    The extensibility of R makes this possible through added            functionality
    being made available in an add-on package called BrailleR. Functions in this package            are
    intended to make graphical information available in text form.'

    PIN: Measuring Asymmetric Information in Financial Markets
              with R
  author: Paolo Zagaglia
  bibauthor: Paolo Zagaglia
  landing: '2013'
  abstract: The package PIN computes a measure of asymmetric information in financial
    markets, the so-called probability of informed trading. This is obtained from
    a sequential trade model and is used to study the determinants of an asset price.
    Since the probability of informed trading depends on the number of buyand sell-initiated
    trades during a trading day, this paper discusses the entire modelling cycle,
    from data handling to the computation of the probability of informed trading and
    the estimation of parameters for the underlying theoretical model.

  abstract: '  Abstract We present the R package stellaR, which is designed to access
    and manipulate publicly            available stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones
    from the Pisa low-mass database. The procedures            for extracting important
    stages in the evolution of a star from the database, for constructing isochrones            from
    stellar tracks and for interpolating among tracks are discussed and demonstrated.                 Due
    to the advance in the instrumentation, nowadays astronomers can deal with a huge
    amount            of high-quality observational data. In the last decade impressive
    improvements of spectroscopic and            photometric observational capabilities
    made available data which stimulated the research in the glob           ular clusters
    field. The theoretical effort of recovering the evolutionary history of the clusters
    benefits            from the computation of extensive databases of stellar tracks
    and isochrones, such as Pietrinferni et al.            (2006); Dotter et al. (2008);
    Bertelli et al. (2008). We recently computed a large data set of stellar tracks            and
    isochrones, “The Pisa low-mass database” (Dell’Omodarme et al., 2012), with up
    to date physical            and chemical inputs, and made available all the calculations
    to the astrophysical community at the            Centre de Données astronomiques
    de Strasbourg (CDS)1 , a data center dedicated to the collection and            worldwide
    distribution of astronomical data.                 In most databases, the management
    of the information and the extraction of the relevant evolu           tionary
    properties from libraries of tracks and/or isochrones is the responsibility of
    the end users.            Due to its extensive capabilities of data manipulation
    and analysis, however, R is an ideal choice for            these tasks. Nevertheless
    R is not yet well known in astrophysics; up to December 2012 only seven            astronomical
    or astrophysical-oriented packages have been published on CRAN (see the CRAN Task            View
    Chemometrics and Computational Physics).                 The package stellaR (Dell’Omodarme
    and Valle, 2012) is an effort to make available to the astro           physical
    community a basic tool set with the following capabilities: retrieve the required
    calculations            from CDS; plot the information in a suitable form; construct
    by interpolation tracks or isochrones of            compositions different to
    the ones available in the database; construct isochrones for age not included            in
    the database; extract relevant evolutionary points from tracks or isochrones.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The mpoly package is a general purpose collection of tools
    for symbolic computing with            multivariate polynomials in R. In addition
    to basic arithmetic, mpoly can take derivatives of polyno           mials, compute
    Gröbner bases of collections of polynomials, and convert polynomials into a functional            form
    to be evaluated. Among other things, it is hoped that mpoly will provide an R-based
    foundation            for the computational needs of algebraic statisticians.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Microarrays enable the expression levels of thousands of genes
    to be measured simultane           ously. However, only a small fraction of these
    genes are expected to be expressed under different            experimental conditions.
    Nowadays, filtering has been introduced as a step in the microarray pre           processing
    pipeline. Gene filtering aims at reducing the dimensionality of data by filtering
    redundant            features prior to the actual statistical analysis. Previous
    filtering methods focus on the Affymetrix            platform and can not be easily
    ported to the Illumina platform. As such, we developed a filtering            method
    for Illumina bead arrays. We developed an R package, beadarrayFilter, to implement
    the            latter method. In this paper, the main functions in the package
    are highlighted and using many            examples, we illustrate how beadarrayFilter
    can be used to filter bead arrays.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Generalized estimating equation solvers in R only allow for
    a few pre-determined options            for the link and variance functions. We
    provide a package, geeM, which is implemented entirely in R            and allows
    for user specified link and variance functions. The sparse matrix representations
    provided            in the Matrix package enable a fast implementation. To gain
    speed, we make use of analytic inverses            of the working correlation
    when possible and a trick to find quick numeric inverses when an analytic            inverse
    is not available. Through three examples, we demonstrate the speed of geeM, which
    is not            much worse than C implementations like geepack and gee on small
    data sets and faster on large data            sets.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We present the package RcmdrPlugin.temis, a graphical user
    interface for user-friendly            text mining in R. Built as a plug-in to
    the R Commander provided by the Rcmdr package, it brings            together several
    existing packages and provides new features streamlining the process of importing,            managing
    and analyzing a corpus, in addition to saving results and plots to a report file.
    Beyond            common file formats, automated import of corpora from the Dow
    Jones Factiva content provider and            Twitter is supported. Featured analyses
    include vocabulary and dissimilarity tables, terms frequencies,            terms
    specific of levels of a variable, term co-occurrences, time series, correspondence
    analysis and            hierarchical clustering.'

  title: Possible Directions for Improving Dependency Versioning in R
  bibtitle: Possible Directions for Improving Dependency Versioning in R
  author: Jeroen Ooms
  bibauthor: Jeroen Ooms
  landing: '2013'
  abstract: '  Abstract One of the most powerful features of R is its infrastructure
    for contributed code. The            built-in package manager and complementary
    repositories provide a great system for development            and exchange of
    code, and have played an important role in the growth of the platform towards
    the            de-facto standard in statistical computing that it is today. However,
    the number of packages on CRAN            and other repositories has increased
    beyond what might have been foreseen, and is revealing some            limitations
    of the current design. One such problem is the general lack of dependency versioning
    in            the infrastructure. This paper explores this problem in greater
    detail, and suggests approaches taken            by other open source communities
    that might work for R as well. Three use cases are defined that            exemplify
    the issue, and illustrate how improving this aspect of package management could
    increase            reliability while supporting further growth of the R community.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The ability to implement statistical models in the BUGS language
    facilitates Bayesian in           ference by automating MCMC algorithms. Software
    packages that interpret the BUGS language            include OpenBUGS, WinBUGS,
    and JAGS. R packages that link BUGS software to the R environment,            including
    rjags and R2WinBUGS, are widely used in Bayesian analysis. Indeed, many packages
    in            the Bayesian task view on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html)
    depend            on this integration. However, the R and BUGS languages use different
    representations of common            probability density functions, creating a
    potential for errors to occur in the implementation or interpre           tation
    of analyses that use both languages. Here we review different parameterizations
    used by the R            and BUGS languages, describe how to translate between
    the languages, and provide an R function,            r2bugs.distributions, that
    transforms parameterizations from R to BUGS and back again.'
