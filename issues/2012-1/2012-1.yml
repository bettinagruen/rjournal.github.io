  abstract: '  Abstract Many common diseases, such as the flu and cardiovascular disease,
    increase markedly in            winter and dip in summer. These seasonal patterns
    have been part of life for millennia and were            first noted in ancient
    Greece by both Hippocrates and Herodotus. Recent interest has focused on            climate
    change, and the concern that seasons will become more extreme with harsher winter
    and            summer weather. We describe a set of R functions designed to model
    seasonal patterns in disease.            We illustrate some simple descriptive
    and graphical methods, a more complex method that is able to            model
    non-stationary patterns, and the case-crossover to control for seasonal confounding.                 In
    this paper we illustrate some of the functions of the season package (Barnett
    et al., 2012), which            contains a range of functions for analysing seasonal
    health data. We were motivated by the great            interest in seasonality
    found in the health literature, and the relatively small number of seasonal tools            in
    R (or other software packages). The existing seasonal tools in R are:                •
    the baysea function of the timsac package and the decompose and stl functions
    of the stats                    package for decomposing a time series into a trend
    and season;                • the dynlm function of the dynlm package and the ssm
    function of the sspir package for fitting                    dynamic linear models
    with optional seasonal components;                • the arima function of the
    stats package and the Arima function of the forecast package for fitting                    seasonal
    components as part of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model;                    and                •
    the bfast package for detecting breaks in a seasonal pattern.            These
    tools are all useful, but most concern decomposing equally spaced time series
    data. Our package            includes models that can be applied to seasonal patterns
    in unequally spaced data. Such data are            common in observational studies
    when the timing of responses cannot be controlled (e.g. for a postal            survey).                 In
    the health literature much of the analysis of seasonal data uses simple methods
    such as com           paring rates of disease by month or using a cosinor regression
    model, which assumes a sinusoidal            seasonal pattern. We have created
    functions for these simple, but often very effective analyses, as we            describe
    below.                 More complex seasonal analyses examine non-stationary seasonal
    patterns that change over time.            Changing seasonal patterns in health
    are currently of great interest as global warming is predicted to            make
    seasonal changes in the weather more extreme. Hence there is a need for statistical
    tools that            can estimate whether a seasonal pattern has become more
    extreme over time or whether its phase has            changed.                 Ours
    is also the first R package that includes the case-crossover, a useful method
    for controlling for            seasonality.                 This paper illustrates
    just some of the functions of the season package. We show some descriptive            functions
    that give simple means or plots, and functions whose goal is inference based on
    generalised            linear models. The package was written as a companion to
    a book on seasonal analysis by Barnett and            Dobson (2010), which contains
    further details on the statistical methods and R code.'

  abstract: '  Abstract MARSS is a package for fitting multivariate autoregressive
    state-space models to time-series            data. The MARSS package implements
    state-space models in a maximum likelihood framework. The            core functionality
    of MARSS is based on likelihood maximization using the Kalman filter/smoother,            combined
    with an EM algorithm. To make comparisons with other packages available, parameter            estimation
    is also permitted via direct search routines available in ’optim’. The MARSS package
    allows            data to contain missing values and allows a wide variety of
    model structures and constraints to be            specified (such as fixed or
    shared parameters). In addition to model-fitting, the package provides            bootstrap
    routines for simulating data and generating confidence intervals, and multiple
    options for            calculating model selection criteria (such as AIC).'

  abstract: '  Abstract The openair package contains data analysis tools for the air
    quality community. This paper            provides an overview of data importers,
    main functions, and selected utilities and workhorse functions            within
    the package and the function output class, as of package version 0.4-14. It is
    intended as an            explanation of the rationale for the package and a technical
    description for those wishing to work            more interactively with the main
    functions or develop additional functions to support ‘higher level’            use
    of openair and R.                Large volumes of air quality data are routinely
    collected for regulatory purposes, but few of those            in local authorities
    and government bodies tasked with this responsibility have the time, expertise            or
    funds to comprehensively analyse this potential resource (Chow and Watson, 2008).
    Furthermore,            few of these institutions can routinely access the more
    powerful statistical methods typically required            to make the most effective
    use of such data without a suite of often expensive and niche-application            proprietary
    software products. This in turn places large cost and time burdens on both these
    institutions            and others (e.g. academic or commercial) wishing to contribute
    to this work. In addition, such            collaborative working practices can
    also become highly restricted and polarised if data analysis            undertaken
    by one partner cannot be validated or replicated by another because they lack
    access to            the same licensed products.                Being freely distributed
    under general licence, R has the obvious potential to act as a common            platform
    for those routinely collecting and archiving data and the wider air quality community.            This
    potential has already been proven in several other research areas, and commonly
    cited ex           amples include the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al, 2004)
    and the Epitools collaboration            (http://www.medepi.com/epitools). However,
    what is perhaps most inspiring is the degree of trans           parency that has
    been demonstrated by the recent public analysis of climate change data in R and
    as           sociated open debate (http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/category/r-climate-data-analysis           tool/).
    Anyone affected by a policy decision, could potentially have unlimited access
    to scrutinise            both the tools and data used to shape that decision.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We present an improved Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for
    R to call arbitary native            functions without the need for C wrapper
    code. Further we discuss a dynamic linkage framework for            binding standard
    C libraries to R across platforms using a universal type information format. The            package
    rdyncall comprises the framework and an initial repository of cross-platform bindings
    for            standard libraries such as (legacy and modern) OpenGL, the family
    of SDL libraries and Expat. The            package enables system-level programming
    using the R language; sample applications are given in            the article.
    We outline the underlying automation tool-chain that extracts cross-platform bindings            from
    C headers, making the repository extendable and open for library developers.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The Apple Xgrid system provides access to groups (or grids)
    of computers that can be used            to facilitate parallel processing. We
    describe the xgrid package which facilitates access to this system            to
    undertake independent simulations or other long-running jobs that can be divided
    into replicate            runs within R. Detailed examples are provided to demonstrate
    the interface, along with results from a            simulation study of the performance
    gains using a variety of grids. Use of the grid for “embarassingly            parallel”
    independent jobs has the potential for major speedups in time to completion. Appendices            provide
    guidance on setting up the workflow, utilizing add-on packages, and constructing
    grids using            existing machines.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Sumo is a web application intended as a template for developers.
    It is distributed as a Java           ‘war’ file that deploys automatically when
    placed in a Servlet container’s ‘webapps’ directory. If a user            supplies
    proper credentials, Sumo creates a session-specific Secure Shell connection to
    the host and a            user-specific R session over that connection. Developers
    may write dynamic server pages that make            use of the persistent R session
    and user-specific file space. The supplied example plots a data set            conditional
    on preferences indicated by the user; it also displays some static text. A companion
    server            page allows the user to interact directly with the R session.
    Sumo’s novel feature set complements            previous efforts to supply R functionality
    over the internet.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Computational infrastructure for representing persons and
    citations has been available in R            for several years, but has been restructured
    through enhanced classes "person" and "bibentry" in            recent versions
    of R. The new features include support for the specification of the roles of package            authors
    (e.g. maintainer, author, contributor, translator, etc.) and more flexible formatting/printing            tools
    among various other improvements. Here, we introduce the new classes and their
    methods            and indicate how this functionality is employed in the management
    of R packages. Specifically, we            show how the authors of R packages
    can be specified along with their roles in package ‘DESCRIPTION’            and/or
    ‘CITATION’ files and the citations produced from it.                 R packages
    are the result of scholarly activity and as such constitute scholarly resources
    which            must be clearly identifiable for the respective scientific communities
    and, more generally, today’s            information society. In particular, packages
    published by standard repositories can be regarded as            reliable sources
    which can and should be referenced (i.e. cited) by scientific works such as articles
    or            other packages. This requires conceptual frameworks and computational
    infrastructure for describing            bibliographic resources, general enough
    to encompass the needs of communities with an interest in R.            These
    needs include support for exporting bibliographic metadata in standardized formats
    such as            BIBTEX (Berry and Patashnik, 2010), but also facilitating bibliometric
    analyses and investigations of the            social fabric underlying the creation
    of scholarly knowledge.                 The latter requires a richer vocabulary
    than commonly employed by reference management            software such as BIBTEX,
    identifying persons and their roles in relation to bibliographic resources. For            example,
    a thesis typically has an author and advisors. Software can have an (original)
    author and a            translator to another language (such as from S to R).
    The maintainer of an R package is not necessarily            an author.                 In
    this paper, we introduce the base R infrastructure (as completely available in
    R since version            2.14.0) for representing and manipulating such scholarly
    data: objects of class "person" (hereafter, per           son objects) hold information
    about persons, possibly including their roles; objects of class "bibentry"            (hereafter,
    bibentry objects) hold bibliographic information in enhanced BIBTEX style, ideally
    using            person objects when referring to persons (such as authors or
    editors). Furthermore, we indicate how            this functionality is employed
    in the management of R packages, in particular in their ‘CITATION’ and           ‘DESCRIPTION’
    files.'
