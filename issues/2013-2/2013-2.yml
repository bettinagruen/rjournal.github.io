    factorplot: Improving Presentation of Simple Contrasts in
              Generalized Linear Models

  abstract: '  Abstract Recent statistical literature has paid attention to the presentation
    of pairwise comparisons            either from the point of view of the reference
    category problem in generalized linear models (GLMs)            or in terms of
    multiple comparisons. Both schools of thought are interested in the parsimonious            presentation
    of sufficient information to enable readers to evaluate the significance of contrasts            resulting
    from the inclusion of qualitative variables in GLMs. These comparisons also arise
    when            trying to interpret multinomial models where one category of the
    dependent variable is omitted as            a reference. While considerable advances
    have been made, opportunities remain to improve the            presentation of
    this information, especially in graphical form. The factorplot package provides
    new            functions for graphically and numerically presenting results of
    hypothesis tests related to pairwise            comparisons resulting from qualitative
    covariates in GLMs or coefficients in multinomial logistic            regression
    models.'

    spMC: Modelling Spatial Random Fields with Continuous Lag

  landing: '2013'
  abstract: '  Abstract Currently, a part of the R statistical software is developed
    in order to deal with spatial models.            More specifically, some available
    packages allow the user to analyse categorical spatial random            patterns.
    However, only the spMC package considers a viewpoint based on transition probabilities            between
    locations. Through the use of this package it is possible to analyse the spatial
    variability of            data, make inference, predict and simulate the categorical
    classes in unobserved sites. An example is            presented by analysing the
    well-known Swiss Jura data set.'

  abstract: ' Abstract Nucleic acid Melting Curve Analysis is a powerful method to
    investigate the interaction           of double stranded nucleic acids. Many researchers
    rely on closed source software which is not           ubiquitously available,
    and gives only little control over the computation and data presentation.           R
    in contrast, is open source, highly adaptable and provides numerous utilities
    for data import,           sophisticated statistical analysis and presentation
    in publication quality. This article covers methods,           implemented in
    the MBmca package, for DNA Melting Curve Analysis on microbead surfaces.           Particularly,
    the use of the second derivative melting peaks is suggested as an additional parameter
    to           characterize the melting behavior of DNA duplexes. Examples of microbead
    surface Melting Curve           Analysis on fragments of human genes are presented.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The pa package provides tools for conducting performance attribution
    for long-only, single            currency equity portfolios. The package uses
    two methods: the Brinson-Hood-Beebower model            (hereafter referred to
    as the Brinson model) and a regression-based analysis. The Brinson model takes            an
    ANOVA-type approach and decomposes the active return of any portfolio into asset
    allocation,            stock selection, and interaction effect. The regression-based
    analysis utilizes estimated coefficients,            based on a regression model,
    to attribute active return to different factors.'

    ExactCIdiff: An R Package for Computing Exact Confidence
              Intervals for the Difference of Two Proportions
  author:

  bibauthor: Guogen Shan and Weizhen Wang
  landing: '2013'
  abstract: '  Abstract Comparing two proportions through the difference is a basic
    problem in statistics and has            applications in many fields. More than
    twenty confidence intervals (Newcombe, 1998a,b) have been            proposed.
    Most of them are approximate intervals with an asymptotic infimum coverage probability            much
    less than the nominal level. In addition, large sample may be costly in practice.
    So exact            optimal confidence intervals become critical for drawing valid
    statistical inference with accuracy and            precision. Recently, Wang (2010,
    2012) derived the exact smallest (optimal) one-sided 1 − α confidence            intervals
    for the difference of two paired or independent proportions. His intervals, however,
    are            computer-intensive by nature. In this article, we provide an R
    package ExactCIdiff to implement the            intervals when the sample size
    is not large. This would be the first available package in R to calculate            the
    exact confidence intervals for the difference of proportions. Exact two-sided
    1 − α interval can be            easily obtained by taking the intersection of
    the lower and upper one-sided 1 − α/2 intervals. Readers            may jump to
    Examples 1 and 2 to obtain these intervals.'

  abstract: '  Abstract There is a lack of robust statistical analyses for random
    effects linear models. In practice,            statistical analyses, including
    estimation, prediction and inference, are not reliable when data are            unbalanced,
    of small size, contain outliers, or not normally distributed. It is fortunate
    that rank-based            regression analysis is a robust nonparametric alternative
    to likelihood and least squares analysis. We            propose an R package that
    calculates rank-based statistical analyses for twoand three-level random            effects
    nested designs. In this package, a new algorithm which recursively obtains robust
    predictions            for both scale and random effects is used, along with three
    rank-based fitting methods.'

  title: Dynamic Parallelization of R Functions
  bibtitle: Dynamic Parallelization of R Functions
  author: Stefan Böhringer
  bibauthor: Stefan Böhringer
  landing: '2013'
  abstract: '  Abstract R offers several extension packages that allow it to perform
    parallel computations. These            operate on fixed points in the program
    flow and make it difficult to deal with nested parallelism and            to organize
    parallelism in complex computations in general. In this article we discuss, first,
    of how to            detect parallelism in functions, and second, how to minimize
    user intervention in that process. We            present a solution that requires
    minimal code changes and enables to flexibly and dynamically choose            the
    degree of parallelization in the resulting computation. An implementation is provided
    by the R            package parallelize.dynamic and practical issues are discussed
    with the help of examples.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The aim of this contribution is to connect two previously
    separated worlds: robotic application            development with the Robot Operating
    System (ROS) and statistical programming with R. This            fruitful combination
    becomes apparent especially in the analysis and visualization of sensory data.
    We            therefore introduce a new language extension for ROS that allows
    to implement nodes in pure R. All            relevant aspects are described in
    a step-by-step development of a common sensor data transformation            node.
    This includes the reception of raw sensory data via the ROS network, message interpretation,            bag-file
    analysis, transformation and visualization, as well as the transmission of newly
    generated            messages back into the ROS network.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper illustrates the usage of the betategarch package,
    a package for the simulation,            estimation and forecasting of Beta-Skew-t-EGARCH
    models. The Beta-Skew-t-EGARCH model is            a dynamic model of the scale
    or volatility of financial returns. The model is characterised by its            robustness
    to jumps or outliers, and by its exponential specification of volatility. The
    latter enables            richer dynamics, since parameters need not be restricted
    to be positive to ensure positivity of volatility.            In addition, the
    model also allows for heavy tails and skewness in the conditional return (i.e.
    scaled            return), and for leverage and a time-varying long-term component
    in the volatility specification. More            generally, the model can be viewed
    as a model of the scale of the error in a dynamic regression.'
