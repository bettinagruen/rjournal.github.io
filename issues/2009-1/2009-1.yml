  title: Facets of R

  abstract: We are seeing today a widespread, and welcome, tendency for non-computer-specialists
    among statisticians and others to write collections of R functions that organize
    and communicate their work. Along with the flood of software sometimes comes an
    attitude that one need only learn, or teach, a sort of basic how-to-write-the-function
    level of R programming, beyond which most of the detail is unimportant or can
    be absorbed without much discussion. As delusions go, this one is not very objectionable
    if it encourages participation. Nevertheless, a delusion it is. In fact, functions
    are only one of a variety of important facets that R has acquired by intent or
    circumstance during the three-plus decades of the history of the software and
    of its predecessor S. To create valuable and trustworthy software using R often
    requires an understanding of some of these facets and their interrelations. This
    paper identifies six facets, discussing where they came from, how they support
    or conflict with each other, and what implications they have for the future of
    programming with R.

  abstract: 'Open source software (OSS) is typically created in a decentralized self-organizing
    process by a community of developers having the same or similar interests (see
    the famous essay by ?). A key factor for the success of OSS over the last two
    decades is the Internet: Developers who rarely meet face-to-face can employ new
    means of communication, both for rapidly writing and deploying software (in the
    spirit of Linus Torvald’s “release early, release often paradigm”). Therefore,
    many tools emerged that assist a collaborative software development process, including
    in particular tools for source code management (SCM) and version control.'

  abstract: R provides a number of well-known high-level facilities for producing
    sophisticated statistical plots, including the “traditional” plots in the graphics
    package (R Development Core Team, 2008), the Trellis-style plots provided by lattice
    (Sarkar, 2008), and the grammar-of-graphics-inspired approach of ggplot2 (Wickham,
    2009).

  abstract: HTML documents are structured documents made of diverse elements such
    as paragraphs, sections, columns, figures and tables organized in a hierarchical
    layout. Combination of HTML documents and hyperlinking is useful to report analysis
    results; for example, in the package arrayQualityMetrics, estimating the quality
    of microarray data sets and cellHTS2, performing the analysis of cell-based screens.

  abstract: The expert package provides tools to create and manipulate empirical statistical
    models using expert opinion (or judgment). Here, the latter expression refers
    to a specific body of techniques to elicit the distribution of a random variable
    when data is scarce or unavailable. Opinions on the quantiles of the distribution
    are sought from experts in the field and aggregated into a final estimate. The
    package supports aggregation by means of the Cooke, Mendel–Sheridan and predefined
    weights models.

  abstract: '? proposed a numerical algorithm for evaluating multivariate normal probabilities.
    Starting with version 0.9-0 of the mvtnorm package (??), this algorithm is available
    to the R community. We give a brief introduction to Miwa’s procedure and compare
    it to a quasi-randomized Monte-Carlo procedure proposed by ?, which has been available
    through mvtnorm for some years now, both with respect to computing time and accuracy.'

  landing: '2009'
  abstract: The concept of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert spectrum
    (HS) has been developed rapidly in many disciplines of science and engineering
    since Huang et al. (1998) invented EMD. The key feature of EMD is to decompose
    a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF). Furthermore, the Hilbert
    spectral analysis of intrinsic mode functions provides frequency information evolving
    with time and quantifies the amount of variation due to oscillation at different
    time scales and time locations. In this article, we introduce an R package called
    EMD (Kim and Oh, 2008) that performs oneand twodimensional EMD and HS.

  abstract: Microarray experiments are becoming more and more popular and critical
    in many biological disciplines. As in any statistical experiment, appropriate
    experimental design is essential for reliable statistical inference, and sample
    size has a crucial role in experimental design. Because microarray experiments
    are rather costly, it is important to have an adequate sample size that will achieve
    a desired power without wasting resources.

  abstract: Many statistical analysis task in areas such as bioinformatics are computationally
    very intensive, while lots of them rely on embarrasingly parallel computations
    (Ananth Grama, 2003). Multiple computers or even multiple processor cores on standard
    desktop computers, which are widespread available nowadays, can easily contribute
    to faster analyses.

  abstract: The PMML package exports a variety of predictive and descriptive models
    from R to the Predictive Model Markup Language (Data Mining Group, 2008). PMML
    is an XML-based language and has become the de-facto standard to represent not
    only predictive and descriptive models, but also data preand post-processing.
    In so doing, it allows for the interchange of models among different tools and
    environments, mostly avoiding proprietary issues and incompatibilities.
