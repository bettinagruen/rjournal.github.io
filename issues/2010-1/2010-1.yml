  abstract: IsoGene is an R package for the analysis of dose-response microarray experiments
    to identify gene or subsets of genes with a monotone relationship between the
    gene expression and the doses. Several testing procedures (i.e., the likelihood
    ratio test, Williams, Marcus, the M, and Modified M), that take into account the
    order restriction of the means with respect to the increasing doses are implemented
    in the package. The inference is based on resampling methods, both permutations
    and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM).

  abstract: The glmmBUGS package is a bridging tool between Generalized Linear Mixed
    Models (GLMMs) in R and the BUGS language. It provides a simple way of performing
    Bayesian inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, taking a model
    formula and data frame in R and writing a BUGS model file, data file, and initial
    values files. Functions are provided to reformat and summarize the BUGS results.
    A key aim of the package is to provide files and objects that can be modified
    prior to calling BUGS, giving users a platform for customizing and extending the
    models to accommodate a wide variety of analyses.

  abstract: The article introduces the cshapes R package, which includes our CShapes
    dataset of contemporary and historical country boundaries, as well as computational
    tools for computing geographical measures from these maps. We provide an overview
    of the need for considering spatial dependence in comparative research, how this
    requires appropriate historical maps, and detail how the cshapes associated R
    package cshapes can contribute to these ends. We illustrate the use of the package
    for drawing maps, computing spatial variables for countries, and generating weights
    matrices for spatial statistics.

  abstract: '  Abstract In this article we present tmvtnorm, an R package implementation
    for the truncated mul           tivariate normal distribution. We consider random
    number generation with rejection and Gibbs            sampling, computation of
    marginal densities as well as computation of the mean and covariance of            the
    truncated variables. This contribution brings together latest research in this
    field and provides            useful methods for both scholars and practitioners
    when working with truncated normal variables.'

  abstract: Artificial neural networks are applied in many situations. neuralnet is
    built to train multilayer perceptrons in the context of regression analyses, i.e.
    to approximate functional relationships between covariates and response variables.
    Thus, neural networks are used as extensions of generalized linear models.       neuralnet
    is a very flexible package. The backpropagation algorithm and three versions of
    resilient backpropagation are implemented and it provides a custom-choice of activation
    and error function. An arbitrary number of covariates and response variables as
    well as of hidden layers can theoretically be included.       The paper gives
    a brief introduction to multi-layer perceptrons and resilient backpropagation
    and demonstrates the application of neuralnet using the data set infert, which
    is contained in the R distribution.

  abstract: '  Abstract We introduce a new R package called glmperm for inference
    in generalized linear models            especially for small and moderate-sized
    data sets. The inference is based on the permutation of            regressor residuals
    test introduced by Potter (2005). The implementation of glmperm outperforms            currently
    available permutation test software as glmperm can be applied in situations where
    more            than one covariate is involved.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper presents an example of online reproducible multivariate
    data analysis. This            example is based on a web page providing an online
    computing facility on a server. HTML forms            contain editable R code
    snippets that can be executed in any web browser thanks to the Rweb software.            The
    example is based on the multivariate analysis of DNA fingerprints of the internal
    bacterial flora            of the poultry red mite Dermanyssus gallinae. Several
    multivariate data analysis methods from the            ade4 package are used to
    compare the fingerprints of mite pools coming from various poultry farms.            All
    the computations and graphical displays can be redone interactively and further
    explored online,            using only a web browser. Statistical methods are
    detailed in the duality diagram framework, and a            discussion about online
    reproducibility is initiated.'

  title: Two-sided Exact Tests and Matching Confidence Intervals for Discrete Data

    Two-sided Exact Tests and Matching Confidence Intervals for
              Discrete Data
  author: Michael P. Fay
  bibauthor: Michael P. Fay
  landing: '2010'
  abstract: '  Abstract There is an inherent relationship between two-sided hypothesis
    tests and confidence intervals.            A series of two-sided hypothesis tests
    may be inverted to obtain the matching 100(1-α)% confidence            interval
    defined as the smallest interval that contains all point null parameter values
    that would not            be rejected at the α level. Unfortunately, for discrete
    data there are several different ways of defining            two-sided exact tests
    and the most commonly used two-sided exact tests are defined one way, while            the
    most commonly used exact confidence intervals are inversions of tests defined
    another way. This            can lead to inconsistencies where the exact test
    rejects but the exact confidence interval contains the            null parameter
    value. The packages exactci and exact2x2 provide several exact tests with the
    matching            confidence intervals avoiding these inconsistencies as much
    as possible. Examples are given for            binomial and Poisson parameters
    and both paired and unpaired 2 × 2 tables.                 Applied statisticians
    are increasingly being encouraged to report confidence intervals (CI) and            parameter
    estimates along with p-values from hypothesis tests. The htest class of the stats
    package            is ideally suited to these kinds of analyses, because all the
    related statistics may be presented when            the results are printed. For
    exact two-sided tests applied to discrete data, a test-CI inconsistency may            occur:
    the p-value may indicate a significant result at level α while the associated
    100(1-α)% confidence            interval may cover the null value of the parameter.
    Ideally, we would like to present a unified report            (Hirji, 2006), whereby
    the p-value and the confidence interval match as much as possible.'
