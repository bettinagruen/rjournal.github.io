  abstract: '  Abstract We present some ways of using R in Excel and build an example
    application using the            package rpart. Starting with simple interactive
    use of rpart in Excel, we eventually package the code            into an Excel-based
    application, hiding all details (including R itself) from the end user. In the
    end, our            application implements a service-oriented architecture (SOA)
    with a clean separation of presentation            and computation layer.'

    glm2: Fitting Generalized Linear Models with Convergence
              Problems
  author: Ian C. Marschner
  bibauthor: Ian C. Marschner
  landing: '2011'
  abstract: '  Abstract The R function glm uses step-halving to deal with certain
    types of convergence problems            when using iteratively reweighted least
    squares to fit a generalized linear model. This works well in            some
    circumstances but non-convergence remains a possibility, particularly with a non-standard
    link            function. In some cases this is because step-halving is never
    invoked, despite a lack of convergence. In            other cases step-halving
    is invoked but is unable to induce convergence. One remedy is to impose a            stricter
    form of step-halving than is currently available in glm, so that the deviance
    is forced to decrease            in every iteration. This has been implemented
    in the glm2 function available in the glm2 package.            Aside from a modified
    computational algorithm, glm2 operates in exactly the same way as glm and            provides
    improved convergence properties. These improvements are illustrated here with
    an identity            link Poisson model, but are also relevant in other contexts.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We discuss the facilities in base R for spell checking via
    Aspell, Hunspell or Ispell, which are            useful in particular for conveniently
    checking the spelling of natural language texts in package Rd            files
    and vignettes. Spell checking performance is illustrated using the Rd files in
    package stats. This            example clearly indicates the need for a domain-specific
    statistical dictionary. We analyze the results            of spell checking all
    Rd files in all CRAN packages and show how these can be employed for building            such
    a dictionary.'

  abstract: '  Abstract            The heuristic k-means algorithm, widely used for
    cluster analysis, does not guarantee optimality. We            developed a dynamic
    programming algorithm for optimal one-dimensional clustering. The algorithm            is
    implemented as an R package called Ckmeans.1d.dp. We demonstrate its advantage
    in optimality            and runtime over the standard iterative k-means algorithm.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Methodology extending nonparametric goodness-of-fit tests
    to discrete null distributions has            existed for several decades. However,
    modern statistical software has generally failed to provide this            methodology
    to users. We offer a revision of R’s ks.test() function and a new cvm.test() function            that
    fill this need in the R language for two of the most popular nonparametric goodness-of-fit
    tests.            This paper describes these contributions and provides examples
    of their usage. Particular attention is            given to various numerical
    issues that arise in their implementation.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The googleVis package provides an interface between R and
    the Google Visualisation API            to create interactive charts which can
    be embedded into web pages. The best known of these charts            is probably
    the Motion Chart, popularised by Hans Rosling in his TED talks. With the googleVis            package
    users can easily create web pages with interactive charts based on R data frames
    and display            them either via the local R HTTP help server or within
    their own sites.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This article presents GrapheR, a Graphical User Interface
    allowing the user to draw customiz           able and high-quality graphs without
    knowing any R commands. Six kinds of graph are available:            histograms,
    box-and-whisker plots, bar plots, pie charts, curves and scatter plots. The complete            process
    is described with the examples of a bar plot and a scatter plot illustrating the
    legendary puzzle            of African and European swallows’ migrations.'

  abstract: Recent advances in computer technology have tremendously increased the
    use of functional data, whose graphical representation can be infinite-dimensional
    curves, images or shapes. This article describes four methods for visualizing
    functional time series using an R add-on package. These methods are demonstrated
    using age-specific Australian fertility data from 1921 to 2006 and monthly sea
    surface temperatures from January 1950 to December 2006.

    In many cases, these errors            are due to non-portable C++ code. This
