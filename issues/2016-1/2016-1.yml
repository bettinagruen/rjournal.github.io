    metaplus: An R Package for the Analysis of Robust Meta-

  landing: '2016'
  abstract: '  Abstract The metaplus package is described with examples of its use
    for fitting meta-analysis and            meta-regression. For either meta-analysis
    or meta-regression it is possible to fit one of three models:            standard
    normal random effect, t-distribution random effect or mixture of normal random
    effects. The            latter two models allow for robustness by allowing for
    a random effect distribution with heavier tails            than the normal distribution,
    and for both robust models the presence of outliers may be tested using            the
    parametric bootstrap. For the mixture of normal random effects model the outlier
    studies may be            identified through their posterior probability of membership
    in the outlier component of the mixture.            Plots allow the results of
    the different models to be compared. The package is demonstrated on three            examples:
    a meta-analysis with no outliers, a meta-analysis with an outlier and a meta-regression
    with            an outlier.'

    Gender Prediction Methods Based on First Names with

  author: Kamil Wais

  landing: '2016'
  abstract: '  Abstract In recent years, there has been increased interest in methods
    for gender prediction based on            first names that employ various open
    data sources. These methods have applications from bibliometric            studies
    to customizing commercial offers for web users. Analysis of gender disparities
    in science based            on such methods are published in the most prestigious
    journals, although they could be improved            by choosing the most suited
    prediction method with optimal parameters and performing validation            studies
    using the best data source for a given purpose. There is also a need to monitor
    and report how            well a given prediction method works in comparison to
    others. In this paper, the author recommends            a set of tools (including
    one dedicated to gender prediction, the R package called genderizeR), data            sources
    (including the genderize.io API), and metrics that could be fully reproduced and
    tested in            order to choose the optimal approach suitable for different
    gender analyses.'

    rTableICC: An R Package for Random Generation of 22K and RC
              Contingency Tables
  author: Haydar Demirhan
  bibauthor: Haydar Demirhan
  landing: '2016'
  abstract: '  Abstract In this paper, we describe the R package rTableICC that provides
    an interface for random            generation of 2×2×K and R×C contingency tables
    constructed over either intraclass-correlated or            uncorrelated individuals.
    Intraclass correlations arise in studies where sampling units include more            than
    one individual and these individuals are correlated. The package implements random
    generation            of contingency tables over individuals with or without intraclass
    correlations under various sampling            plans. The package include two
    functions for the generation of K 2×2 tables over product-multinomial            sampling
    schemes and that of 2×2×K tables under Poisson or multinomial sampling plans.
    It also            contains two functions that generate R×C tables under product-multinomial,
    multinomial or Poisson            sampling plans with or without intraclass correlations.
    The package also includes a function for            random number generation from
    a given probability distribution. In addition to the contingency table            format,
    the package also provides raw data required for further estimation purposes.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This software paper describes ‘Stylometry with R’ (stylo),
    a flexible R package for the high           level analysis of writing style in
    stylometry. Stylometry (computational stylistics) is concerned with the            quantitative
    study of writing style, e.g. authorship verification, an application which has
    considerable            potential in forensic contexts, as well as historical
    research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities            of stylo for
    computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and
    French            literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful
    in the exploratory statistical analysis            of texts, e.g. with respect
    to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user            interface
    for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of
    novices, without            programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities).
    More experienced users can benefit from our            implementation of a series
    of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of similarity            metrics.'

    we describe some implementation details, such as how to avoid            the problems
    associated to round-off errors in the maximisation of the likelihood or the use
    of closures            and non-standard evaluation functions.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In multiple regression models, when there are a large number
    (p) of explanatory variables            which may or may not be relevant for predicting
    the response, it is useful to be able to reduce the model.            To this
    end, it is necessary to determine the best subset of q (q ≤ p) predictors which
    will establish            the model with the best prediction capacity. FWDselect
    package introduces a new forward stepwise           based selection procedure
    to select the best model in different regression frameworks (parametric            or
    nonparametric). The developed methodology, which can be equally applied to linear
    models,            generalized linear models or generalized additive models, aims
    to introduce solutions to the following            two topics: i) selection of
    the best combination of q variables by using a step-by-step method; and,            perhaps,
    most importantly, ii) search for the number of covariates to be included in the
    model based            on bootstrap resampling techniques. The software is illustrated
    using real and simulated data.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Social network analysis is extremely well supported by the
    R community and is routinely            used for studying the relationships between
    people engaged in collaborative activities. While there            has been rapid
    development of new approaches and metrics in this field, the challenging question            of
    validity (how well insights derived from social networks agree with reality) is
    often difficult to            address. We propose the use of several R packages
    to generate interactive surveys that are specifically            well suited for
    validating social network analyses. Using our web-based survey application, we
    were            able to validate the results of applying community-detection algorithms
    to infer the organizational            structure of software developers contributing
    to open-source projects.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In crossed, two-factor studies with one observation per factor-level
    combination, interaction            effects between factors can be hard to detect
    and can make the choice of a suitable statistical model            difficult.
    This article describes hiddenf, an R package that enables users to quantify and
    characterize a            certain form of interaction in two-factor layouts. When
    effects of one factor (a) fall into two groups            depending on the level
    of another factor, and (b) are constant within these groups, the interaction            pattern
    is deemed "hidden additivity" because within groups, the effects of the two factors
    are additive,            while between groups the factors are allowed to interact.
    The hiddenf software can be used to estimate,            test, and report an appropriate
    factorial effects model corresponding to hidden additivity, which is            intermediate
    between the unavailable full factorial model and the overly-simplistic additive
    model.            Further, the software also conducts five statistical tests for
    interaction proposed between 1949 and            2014. A collection of 17 datasets
    is used for illustration.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We present new spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and

    interpolations using these models with a purely spatial kriging approach. The
    target variable            of the application is the daily mean PM10 concentration
    measured at rural air quality monitoring            stations across Germany in
    2005. R code for variogram fitting and interpolation is presented in            this

  abstract: '  Abstract The System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) was implemented
    in 1995 by the US National            Estuarine Research Reserve System. This
    program has provided two decades of continuous monitoring            data at over
    140 fixed stations in 28 estuaries. However, the increasing quantity of data provided
    by the            monitoring network has complicated broad-scale comparisons between
    systems and, in some cases,            prevented simple trend analysis of water
    quality parameters at individual sites. This article describes            the
    SWMPr package that provides several functions that facilitate data retrieval,
    organization, and            analysis of time series data in the reserve estuaries.
    Previously unavailable functions for estuaries are            also provided to
    estimate rates of ecosystem metabolism using the open-water method. The SWMPr            package
    has facilitated a cross-reserve comparison of water quality trends and links quantitative            information

  abstract: '  Abstract In this article, we introduce the R package CryptRndTest that
    performs eight statistical            randomness tests on cryptographic random
    number sequences. The purpose of the package is to            provide software
    implementing recently proposed cryptographic randomness tests utilizing goodness           of-fit
    tests superior to the usual chi-square test in terms of statistical performance.
    Most of the tests            included in package CryptRndTest are not available
    in other software packages such as the R package            RDieHarder or the
    C library TestU01. Chi-square, Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and            Jarque-Bera
    goodness-of-fit procedures are provided along with cryptographic randomness tests.            CryptRndTest
    utilizes multiple precision floating numbers for sequences longer than 64-bit
    based            on the package Rmpfr. By this way, included tests are applied
    precisely for higher bit-lengths. In            addition CryptRndTest provides
    a user friendly interface to these cryptographic randomness tests.            As
    an illustrative application, CryptRndTest is used to test available random number
    generators in R.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Comparing the results obtained by two or more algorithms in
    a set of problems is a central            task in areas such as machine learning
    or optimization. Drawing conclusions from these comparisons            may require
    the use of statistical tools such as hypothesis testing. There are some interesting
    papers            that cover this topic. In this manuscript we present scmamp,
    an R package aimed at being a tool            that simplifies the whole process
    of analyzing the results obtained when comparing algorithms, from            loading
    the data to the production of plots and tables.                 Comparing the
    performance of different algorithms is an essential step in many research and            practical
    computational works. When new algorithms are proposed, they have to be compared
    with            the state of the art. Similarly, when an algorithm is used for
    a particular problem, its performance with            different sets of parameters
    has to be compared, in order to tune them for the best results.                 When
    the differences are very clear (e.g., when an algorithm is the best in all the
    problems used in            the comparison), the direct comparison of the results
    may be enough. However, this is an unusual            situation and, thus, in
    most situations a direct comparison may be misleading and not enough to draw            sound
    conclusions; in those cases, the statistical assessment of the results is advisable.                 The
    statistical comparison of algorithms in the context of machine learning has been
    covered in            several papers. In particular, the tools implemented in
    this package are those presented in Demšar            (2006); García and Herrera
    (2008); García et al. (2010). Another good review that covers, among other            aspects,
    the statistical assessment of the results in the context of supervised classification
    can be found            in Santafé et al. (2015).'

  abstract: '  Abstract Interest in social network analysis has exploded in the past
    few years, partly thanks to            the advancements in statistical methods
    and computing for network analysis. A wide range of the            methods for
    network analysis is already covered by existent R packages. However, no comprehensive            packages
    are available to calculate group centrality scores and to identify key players
    (i.e., those players            who constitute the most central group) in a network.
    These functionalities are important because,            for example, many social
    and health interventions rely on key players to facilitate the intervention.            Identifying
    key players is challenging because players who are individually the most central
    are not            necessarily the most central as a group due to redundancy in
    their connections. In this paper we            develop methods and tools for computing
    group centrality scores and for identifying key players in            social networks.
    We illustrate the methods using both simulated and empirical examples. The package            keyplayer
    providing the presented methods is available from Comprehensive R Archive Network            (CRAN).'

  author: Tibor Szkaliczki
  bibauthor: Tibor Szkaliczki
  landing: '2016'
  abstract: '  Abstract The general clustering algorithms do not guarantee optimality
    because of the hardness of the            problem. Polynomial-time methods can
    find the clustering corresponding to the exact optimum only            in special
    cases. For example, the dynamic programming algorithm can solve the one-dimensional            clustering
    problem, i.e., when the items to be clustered can be characterised by only one
    scalar            number. Optimal one-dimensional clustering is provided by package
    Ckmeans.1d.dp in R. The paper            shows a possible generalisation of the
    method implemented in this package to multidimensional            data: the dynamic
    programming method can be applied to find the optimum clustering of vectors            when
    only subsequent items may form a cluster. Sequential data are common in various
    fields            including telecommunication, bioinformatics, marketing, transportation
    etc. The proposed algorithm            can determine the optima for a range of
    cluster numbers in order to support the case when the number            of clusters
    is not known in advance.'

    faced by data scientists            in various research fields and industry applications.
    Though many clustering evaluation techniques            have been developed to
    solve this problem, the recently developed algorithm Progeny Clustering            is

    In this paper, we            introduce an R package progenyClust that implements

  abstract: '  Abstract In recent years, the cost of DNA sequencing has decreased
    at a rate that has outpaced            improvements in memory capacity. It is
    now common to collect or have access to many gigabytes            of biological
    sequences. This has created an urgent need for approaches that analyze sequences
    in            subsets without requiring all of the sequences to be loaded into
    memory at one time. It has also opened            opportunities to improve the
    organization and accessibility of information acquired in sequencing            projects.
    The DECIPHER package offers solutions to these problems by assisting in the curation
    of            large sets of biological sequences stored in compressed format inside
    a database. This approach has            many practical advantages over standard
    bioinformatics workflows, and enables large analyses that            would otherwise
    be prohibitively time consuming.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The adoption of high-quality tools for collaboration and reproducibile
    research such as R            and Github is becoming more common in many research
    fields. While Github and other version            management systems are excellent
    resources, they were originally designed to handle code and scale            poorly
    to large text-based or binary datasets. A number of scientific data repositories
    are coming            online and are often focused on dataset archival and publication.
    To handle collaborative workflows            using large scientific datasets,
    there is increasing need to connect cloud-based online data storage to            R.
    In this article, we describe how the new R package sbtools enables direct access
    to the advanced            online data functionality provided by ScienceBase,
    the U.S. Geological Survey’s online scientific data            storage platform.'
