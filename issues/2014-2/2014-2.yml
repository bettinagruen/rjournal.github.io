  abstract: '  Abstract This paper outlines how to conduct a simple meta-analysis
    of neuroimaging foci of activation            in R. In particular, the first part
    of this paper reviews the nature of fMRI data, and briefly overviews            the
    existing packages that can be used to analyze fMRI data in R. The second part
    illustrates how            to handle fMRI data by showing how to visualize the
    results of different neuroimaging studies in a            so-called orthographic
    view, where the spatial distribution of the foci of activation from different
    fMRI            studies can be inspected visually.                 Functional
    MRI (fMRI) is one of the most important and powerful tools of neuroscientific
    research.            Although not as commonly used for fMRI analysis as some specific
    applications such as SPM (Friston            et al., 2006), AFNI (Cox and Hyde,
    1997), or FSL (Smith et al., 2004), R does provide several packages            that
    can be employed in neuroimaging research. These packages deal with a variety of
    topics, ranging            from reading and manipulating fMRI datasets, to implementing
    sophisticated statistical models.                 The goal of this paper is to
    provide a brief introduction to fMRI analysis, and the various R            packages
    that can be used to carry it out. As an example, it will show how to use simple
    R commands            to read fMRI images and plot results from previous studies,
    which can then be visually compared. This            is a special form of meta-analysis,
    and a common way to compare results from the existing literature.'

  title: Automatic Conversion of Tables to LongForm Dataframes
  bibtitle: Automatic Conversion of Tables to LongForm Dataframes
  author: Jimmy Oh
  bibauthor: Jimmy Oh
  landing: '2014'
  abstract: '  Abstract TableToLongForm automatically converts hierarchical Tables
    intended for a human reader            into a simple LongForm dataframe that is
    machine readable, making it easier to access and use the data            for analysis.
    It does this by recognising positional cues present in the hierarchical Table
    (which would            normally be interpreted visually by the human brain) to
    decompose, then reconstruct the data into a            LongForm dataframe. The
    article motivates the benefit of such a conversion with an example Table,            followed
    by a short user manual, which includes a comparison between the simple one argument
    call            to TableToLongForm, with code for an equivalent manual conversion.
    The article then explores the            types of Tables the package can convert
    by providing a gallery of all recognised patterns. It finishes            with
    a discussion of available diagnostic methods and future work.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a common way to study
    the sources of variation in            a high-dimensional data set. Typically,
    the leading principal components are used to understand the            variation
    in the data or to reduce the dimension of the data for subsequent analysis. The
    remaining            principal components are ignored since they explain little
    of the variation in the data. However, the            space spanned by the low
    variation principal components may contain interesting structure, structure            that
    PCA cannot find. Prinsimp is an R package that looks for interesting structure
    of low variability.           “Interesting” is defined in terms of a simplicity
    measure. Looking for interpretable structure in a low            variability space
    has particular importance in evolutionary biology, where such structure can signify            the
    existence of a genetic constraint.'

  landing: '2014'
  abstract: '  Abstract When modelling physical systems, analysts will frequently
    be confronted by differential            equations which cannot be solved analytically.
    In this instance, numerical integration will usually be            the only way
    forward. However, for autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)            in
    one or two dimensions, it is possible to employ an instructive qualitative analysis
    foregoing this            requirement, using so-called phase plane methods. Moreover,
    this qualitative analysis can even prove            to be highly useful for systems
    that can be solved analytically, or will be solved numerically anyway.            The
    package phaseR allows the user to perform such phase plane analyses: determining
    the stability            of any equilibrium points easily, and producing informative
    plots.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Accelerometers are a valuable tool for measuring physical
    activity (PA) in epidemiological            studies. However, considerable processing
    is needed to convert time-series accelerometer data into            meaningful
    variables for statistical analysis. This article describes two recently developed
    R packages            for processing accelerometer data. The package accelerometry
    contains functions for performing            various data processing procedures,
    such as identifying periods of non-wear time and bouts of activity.            The
    functions are flexible, computationally efficient, and compatible with uniaxial
    or triaxial data.            The package nhanesaccel is specifically for processing
    data from the National Health and Nutrition            Examination Survey (NHANES),
    years 2003–2006. Its primary function generates measures of PA            volume,
    intensity, frequency, and patterns according to user-specified data processing
    methods. This            function can process the NHANES 2003-2006 dataset in
    under one minute, which is a drastic improve           ment over existing software.
    This article highlights important features of packages accelerometry and            nhanesaccel
    and demonstrates typical usage for PA researchers.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In attempts to further understand the dynamics of complex
    systems, the application of            computer simulation is becoming increasingly
    prevalent. Whereas a great deal of focus has been            placed in the development
    of software tools that aid researchers develop simulations, similar focus has            not
    been applied in the creation of tools that perform a rigorous statistical analysis
    of results generated            through simulation: vital in understanding how
    these results offer an insight into the captured            system. This encouraged
    us to develop spartan, a package of statistical techniques designed to assist            researchers

  abstract: '  Abstract Two important recent advances in areal modeling are the centered
    autologistic model and            the sparse spatial generalized linear mixed
    model (SGLMM), both of which are reparameterizations            of traditional
    models. The reparameterizations improve regression inference by alleviating spatial            confounding,
    and the sparse SGLMM also greatly speeds computing by reducing the dimension of
    the            spatial random effects. Package ngspatial (’ng’ = non-Gaussian)
    provides routines for fitting these            new models. The package supports

  abstract: '  Abstract In this paper we present a new R package called sgof for multiple
    hypothesis testing. The            principal aim of this package is to implement
    SGoF-type multiple testing methods, known to be            more powerful than
    the classical false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error rate (FWER) based            methods
    in certain situations, particularly when the number of tests is large. This package
    includes Bi           nomial and Conservative SGoF and the Bayesian and Beta-Binomial
    SGoF multiple testing procedures,            which are adaptations of the original
    SGoF method to the Bayesian setting and to possibly correlated            tests,
    respectively. The sgof package also implements the Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli            FDR
    controlling procedures. For each method the package provides (among other things)
    the number            of rejected null hypotheses, estimation of the corresponding
    FDR, and the set of adjusted p values.            Some automatic plots of interest
    are implemented too. Two real data examples are used to illustrate            how
    sgof works.'

  bibauthor: Paola Rebora and Agus Salim and Marie Reilly
  landing: '2014'
  abstract: '  Abstract The hazard function is a key component in the inferential
    process in survival analysis and            relevant for describing the pattern
    of failures. However, it is rarely shown in research papers due            to
    the difficulties in nonparametric estimation. We developed the bshazard package
    to facilitate the            computation of a nonparametric estimate of the hazard
    function, with data-driven smoothing. The            method accounts for left
    truncation, right censoring and possible covariates. B-splines are used to            estimate
    the shape of the hazard within the generalized linear mixed models framework.
    Smoothness is            controlled by imposing an autoregressive structure on
    the baseline hazard coefficients. This perspective            allows an ’automatic’
    smoothing by avoiding the need to choose the smoothing parameter, which is            estimated
    from the data as a dispersion parameter. A simulation study demonstrates the capability            of
    our software and an application to estimate the hazard of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
    in Swedish            population data shows its potential.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Assessing the assumption of multivariate normality is required
    by many parametric mul           tivariate statistical methods, such as MANOVA,
    linear discriminant analysis, principal component            analysis, canonical
    correlation, etc. It is important to assess multivariate normality in order to
    proceed            with such statistical methods. There are many analytical methods
    proposed for checking multivariate            normality. However, deciding which
    method to use is a challenging process, since each method may            give
    different results under certain conditions. Hence, we may say that there is no
    best method, which            is valid under any condition, for normality checking.
    In addition to numerical results, it is very useful            to use graphical
    methods to decide on multivariate normality. Combining the numerical results from            several
    methods with graphical approaches can be useful and provide more reliable decisions.
    Here,            we present an R package, MVN, to assess multivariate normality.
    It contains the three most widely            used multivariate normality tests,
    including Mardia’s, Henze-Zirkler’s and Royston’s, and graphical            approaches,
    including chi-square Q-Q, perspective and contour plots. It also includes two
    multivariate            outlier detection methods, which are based on robust Mahalanobis
    distances. Moreover, this package            offers functions to check the univariate
    normality of marginal distributions through both tests and            plots. Furthermore,
    especially for non-R users, we provide a user-friendly web application of the            package.
    This application is available at http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/MVN/.'

    can be transparently examined, it provides results in a clearly structured            and
    tabulated form ready for further exploration and modelling, it produces a graphical
    summary            of the results, and it generates a more concise report of the
    distinguishing and consensus statements.            This paper introduces the

    large-sample normality of the test statistics nor ignores the contribution to
    the overall Type I error            rate from rejecting one out of the two one-sided
    hypotheses under a null value. The features of gset            include: error
    spending functions, computation of equivalence boundaries and futility boundaries,            either
    binding or nonbinding, depiction of stagewise boundary plots, and operating characteristics            of
    a given group sequential design including empirical Type I error rate, empirical
    power, expected            sample size, and probability of stopping at an interim
    look due to equivalence or futility.'
