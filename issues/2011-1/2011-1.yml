  abstract: '  Abstract Software testing is important, but many of us don’t do it
    because it is frustrating and boring.            testthat is a new testing framework
    for R that is easy learn and use, and integrates with your existing            workflow.
    This paper shows how, with illustrations from existing packages.'

  abstract: Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides tools to examine relationships
    between people. Text Mining (TM) allows capturing the text they produce in Web
    2.0 applications, for example, however it neglects their social structure. This
    paper applies an approach to combine the two methods named “content-based SNA”.
    Using the R mailing lists, R-help and R-devel, we show how this combination can
    be used to describe people’s interests and to find out if authors who have similar
    interests actually communicate. We find that the expected positive relationship
    between sharing interests and communicating gets stronger as the centrality scores
    of authors in the communication networks increase.

  abstract: '  Abstract The management of time and holidays can prove crucial in applications
    that rely on historical            data. A typical example is the aggregation
    of a data set recorded in different time zones and under dif           ferent
    daylight saving time rules. Besides the time zone conversion function, which is
    well supported            by default classes in R, one might need functions to
    handle special days or holidays. In this respect,            the package timeDate
    enhances default date-time classes in R and brings new functionalities to time            zone
    management and the creation of holiday calendars.'

  abstract: '  Abstract I present the small R package digitize, designed to extract
    data from scatterplots with a            simple method and suited to small datasets.
    I present an application of this method to the extraction            of data from
    a graph whose source is not available.'

  abstract: The R package DEoptim implements the Differential Evolution algorithm.
    This algorithm is an evolutionary technique similar to classic genetic algorithms
    that is useful for the solution of global optimization problems. In this note
    we provide an introduction to the package and demonstrate its utility for financial
    applications by solving a non-convex portfolio optimization problem.

  bibtitle: 'rworldmap : a new R package for mapping global data'
  author: Andy South
  bibauthor: Andy South
  landing: '2011'
  abstract: '  Abstract rworldmap is a new package available on CRAN for mapping and
    visualisation of global            data. The vision is to make the display of
    global data easier, to facilitate understanding and com           munication.
    The initial concentration is on data referenced by country or grid due to the
    frequency            of use of such data in global assessments. Tools to link
    data referenced by country (either name or            code) to a map, and then
    to display the map are provided as are functions to map global gridded data.            Country
    and gridded functions accept the same arguments to specify the nature of categories
    and            colour and how legends are formatted. This package builds on the
    functionality of existing packages,            particularly sp, maptools and fields.
    Example code is provided to produce maps, to link with the            packages
    classInt, RColorBrewer and ncdf, and to plot examples of publicly available country
    and            gridded data.'

  landing: '2011'
  abstract: '  Abstract The R graphics engine has new support for rendering raster
    images via the functions            rasterImage() and grid.raster(). This leads
    to better scaling of raster images, faster rendering to            screen, and
    smaller graphics files. Several examples of possible applications of these new
    features are            described.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This article describes two R packages for probabilistic weather
    forecasting, ensembleBMA,            which offers ensemble postprocessing via
    Bayesian model averaging (BMA), and ProbForecastGOP,            which implements
    the geostatistical output perturbation (GOP) method. BMA forecasting models            use
    mixture distributions, in which each component corresponds to an ensemble member,
    and the            form of the component distribution depends on the weather parameter
    (temperature, quantitative            precipitation or wind speed). The model
    parameters are estimated from training data. The GOP            technique uses
    geostatistical methods to produce probabilistic forecasts of entire weather fields
    for            temperature or pressure, based on a single numerical forecast on
    a spatial grid. Both packages include            functions for evaluating predictive
    performance, in addition to model fitting and forecasting.'
