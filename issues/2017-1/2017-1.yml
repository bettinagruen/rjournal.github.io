  abstract: '  Abstract The iotools package provides a set of tools for input and
    output intensive data processing in            R. The functions chunk.apply and
    read.chunk are supplied to allow for iteratively loading contiguous            blocks
    of data into memory as raw vectors. These raw vectors can then be efficiently
    converted            into matrices and data frames with the iotools functions
    mstrsplit and dstrsplit. These functions            minimize copying of data and
    avoid the use of intermediate strings in order to drastically improve            performance.
    Finally, we also provide read.csv.raw to allow users to read an entire dataset
    into            memory with the same efficient parsing code. In this paper, we
    present these functions through a            set of examples with an emphasis
    on the flexibility provided by chunk-wise operations. We provide            benchmarks
    comparing the speed of read.csv.raw to data loading functions provided in base
    R and            other contributed packages.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The analysis of transcriptomic experiments with ordered covariates,
    such as dose-response            data, has become a central topic in bioinformatics,
    in particular in omics studies. Consequently,            multiple R packages on
    CRAN and Bioconductor are designed to analyse microarray data from various            perspectives
    under the assumption of order restriction. We introduce the new R package IsoGene            Graphical
    User Interface (IsoGeneGUI), an extension of the original IsoGene package that
    includes            methods from most of available R packages designed for the
    analysis of order restricted microarray            data, namely orQA, ORIClust,
    goric and ORCME. The methods included in the new IsoGeneGUI            range from
    inference and estimation to model selection and clustering tools. The IsoGeneGUI
    is not            only the most complete tool for the analysis of order restricted
    microarray experiments available in            R but also it can be used to analyse
    other types of dose-response data. The package provides all the            methods
    in a user friendly fashion, so analyses can be implemented by users with limited
    knowledge            of R programming.'

  bibauthor: Sam Tyner and François Briatte and Heike Hofmann
  abstract: '  Abstract This paper explores three different approaches to visualize
    networks by building on the            grammar of graphics framework implemented
    in the ggplot2 package. The goal of each approach is            to provide the
    user with the ability to apply the flexibility of ggplot2 to the visualization
    of network            data, including through the mapping of network attributes
    to specific plot aesthetics. By incorporating            networks in the ggplot2
    framework, these approaches (1) allow users to enhance networks with            additional
    information on edges and nodes, (2) give access to the strengths of ggplot2, such
    as layers            and facets, and (3) convert network data objects to the more
    familiar data frames.'

  abstract: '  Abstract A genome-scale metabolic reconstruction is a compilation of
    all stoichiometric reactions that            can describe the entire cellular
    metabolism of an organism, and they have become an indispensable            tool
    for our understanding of biological phenomena, covering fields that range from
    systems biology            to bioengineering. Interrogation of metabolic reconstructions
    are generally carried through Flux            Balance Analysis, an optimization
    method in which the biological sense of the optimal solution is            highly
    sensitive to thermodynamic unbalance caused by the presence of stoichiometric
    reactions            whose compounds are not produced or consumed in any other
    reaction (orphan metabolites) and            by mass unbalance. The minval package
    was designed as a tool to identify orphan metabolites and            evaluate
    the mass and charge balance of stoichiometric reactions. The package also includes
    functions            to characterize and write models in TSV and SBML formats,

  bibauthor: G. Brooke Anderson and Colin Eason and Elizabeth A. Barnes
  abstract: '  Abstract Research on climate change impacts can require extensive processing
    of climate model output,            especially when using ensemble techniques
    to incorporate output from multiple climate models and            multiple simulations
    of each model. This processing can be particularly extensive when identifying            and
    characterizing multi-day extreme events like heat waves and frost day spells,
    as these must be            processed from model output with daily time steps.
    Further, climate model output is in a format and            follows standards
    that may be unfamiliar to most R users. Here, we provide an overview of working            with
    daily climate model output data in R. We then present the futureheatwaves package,
    which we            developed to ease the process of identifying, characterizing,
    and exploring multi-day extreme events            in climate model output. This
    package can input a directory of climate model output files, identify all            extreme
    events using customizable event definitions, and summarize the output using user-specified            functions.'

  bibauthor: Sean S. Downey and Guowei Sun and Peter Norquest
  abstract: '  Abstract Linguistic distance measurements are commonly used in anthropology
    and biology when            quantitative and statistical comparisons between words
    are needed. This is common, for example,            when analyzing linguistic
    and genetic data. Such comparisons can provide insight into historical            population
    patterns and evolutionary processes. However, the most commonly used linguistic            distances
    are derived from edit distances, which do not weight phonetic features that may,
    for            example, represent smaller-scale patterns in linguistic evolution.
    Thus, computational methods for            calculating feature-weighted linguistic
    distances are needed for linguistic, biological, and evolutionary            applications;
    additionally, the linguistic distances presented here are generic and may have
    broader            applications in fields such as text mining and search, as well
    as applications in psycholinguistics            and morphology. To facilitate
    this research, we are making available an open-source R software            package
    that performs feature-weighted linguistic distance calculations. The package also
    includes a            supervised learning methodology that uses a genetic algorithm
    and manually determined alignments            to estimate 13 linguistic parameters
    including feature weights and a skip penalty. Here we present the            package
    and use it to demonstrate the supervised learning methodology by estimating the
    optimal            linguistic parameters for both simulated data and for a sample
    of Austronesian languages. Our results            show that the methodology can
    estimate these parameters for both simulated and real language            data,
    that optimizing feature weights improves alignment accuracy by approximately 29%,
    and that            optimization significantly affects the resulting distance
    measurements. Availability: alineR is available            on CRAN.'

  title: Implementing a Metapopulation Bass Diffusion Model using the R Package deSolve

    Implementing a Metapopulation Bass Diffusion Model using the
              R Package deSolve
  author: Jim Duggan
  bibauthor: Jim Duggan
  abstract: '  Abstract Diffusion is a fundamental process in physical, biological,
    social and economic settings.            Consumer products often go viral, with
    sales driven by the word of mouth effect, as their adoption            spreads
    through a population. The classic diffusion model used for product adoption is
    the Bass            diffusion model, and this divides a population into two groups
    of people: potential adopters who            are likely to adopt a product, and
    adopters who have purchased the product, and influence others            to adopt.
    The Bass diffusion model is normally captured in an aggregate form, where no significant            consumer
    differences are modeled. This paper extends the Bass model to capture a spatial
    perspective,            using metapopulation equations from the field of infectious
    disease modeling. The paper’s focus is on            simulation of deterministic
    models by solving ordinary differential equations, and does not encompass            parameter
    estimation. The metapopulation model in implemented in R using the deSolve package,            and
    shows the potential of using the R framework to implement large-scale integral
    equation models,            with applications in the field of marketing and consumer
    behaviour.'

  bibauthor: Christian Margreitter and Chris Oostenbrink
  abstract: '  Abstract The MDplot package provides plotting functions to allow for
    automated visualisation of            molecular dynamics simulation output. It
    is especially useful in cases where the plot generation is            rather tedious
    due to complex file formats or when a large number of plots are generated. The
    graphs            that are supported range from those which are standard, such
    as RMSD/RMSF (root-mean-square            deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation,
    respectively) to less standard, such as thermodynamic            integration analysis
    and hydrogen bond monitoring over time. All told, they address many com           monly
    used analyses. In this article, we set out the MDplot package’s functions, give
    examples of the            function calls, and show the associated plots. Plotting
    and data parsing is separated in all cases, i.e.            the respective functions
    can be used independently. Thus, data manipulation and the integration of            additional
    file formats is fairly easy. Currently, the loading functions support GROMOS,
    GROMACS,            and AMBER file formats. Moreover, we also provide a Bash interface
    that allows simple embedding of            MDplot into Bash scripts as the final
    analysis step.            Availability: The package can be obtained in the latest
    major version from CRAN (https://cran.r           project.org/package=MDplot)
    or in the most recent version from the project’s GitHub page at            https://github.com/MDplot/MDplot,

    On Some Extensions to GA Package: Hybrid Optimisation,
              Parallelisation and Islands Evolution
  author: Luca Scrucca
  bibauthor: Luca Scrucca
  abstract: '  Abstract Genetic algorithms are stochastic iterative algorithms in
    which a population of individuals            evolve by emulating the process of
    biological evolution and natural selection. The R package GA            provides
    a collection of general purpose functions for optimisation using genetic algorithms.
    This            paper describes some enhancements recently introduced in version
    3 of the package. In particular,            hybrid GAs have been implemented by
    including the option to perform local searches during the            evolution.
    This allows to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local
    optimiser.            Another major improvement is the provision of facilities
    for parallel computing. Parallelisation has            been implemented using
    both the master-slave approach and the islands evolution model. Several            examples
    of usage are presented, with both real-world data examples and benchmark functions,            showing
    that often high-quality solutions can be obtained more efficiently.'

  bibauthor: Steffen Moritz and Thomas Bartz-Beielstein
  abstract: '  Abstract The imputeTS package specializes on univariate time series
    imputation. It offers multiple            state-of-the-art imputation algorithm
    implementations along with plotting functions for time series            missing
    data statistics. While imputation in general is a well-known problem and widely
    covered by R            packages, finding packages able to fill missing values
    in univariate time series is more complicated. The            reason for this
    lies in the fact, that most imputation algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations,
    while            univariate time series imputation instead needs to employ time
    dependencies. This paper provides an            introduction to the imputeTS package

  abstract: '  Abstract In Data Mining, the value of extracted knowledge is directly
    related to the quality of the            used data. This makes data preprocessing
    one of the most important steps in the knowledge discovery            process.
    A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise. A training set
    with label            noise can reduce the predictive performance of classification
    learning techniques and increase the            overfitting of classification
    models. In this work we present the NoiseFiltersR package. It contains the            first
    extensive R implementation of classical and state-of-the-art label noise filters,
    which are the most            common techniques for preprocessing label noise.
    The algorithms used for the implementation of the            label noise filters
    are appropriately documented and referenced. They can be called in a R-user-friendly            manner,
    and their results are unified by means of the "filter" class, which also benefits
    from adapted            print and summary methods.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In this paper, we describe an R package named coxphMIC, which
    implements the sparse            estimation method for Cox proportional hazards
    models via approximated information criterion (Su            et al., 2016). The
    developed methodology is named MIC which stands for “Minimizing approximated            Information
    Criteria". A reparameterization step is introduced to enforce sparsity while at
    the same            time keeping the objective function smooth. As a result, MIC
    is computationally fast with a superior            performance in sparse estimation.
    Furthermore, the reparameterization tactic yields an additional            advantage
    in terms of circumventing post-selection inference (Leeb and Pötscher, 2005).
    The MIC            method and its R implementation are introduced and illustrated
    with the PBC data.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The use of linear and non-linear mixed models in the life
    sciences and pharmacometrics            is common practice. Estimation of the
    parameters of models not involving a system of differential            equations
    is often done by the R or S-Plus software with the nonlinear mixed effects nlme
    package.            The estimated residual error may be used for diagnosis of
    the fitted model, but not whether the            model correctly describes the
    relation between response and included variables including the true            covariance
    structure. The latter is only true if the residual error is known in advance.
    Therefore, it            may be necessary or more appropriate to fix the residual
    error a priori instead of estimate its value.            This can be the case
    if one wants to include evidence from past studies or a theoretical derivation;            e.g.,
    when using a binomial model. S-Plus has an option to fix this residual error to
    a constant, in            contrast to R. For convenience, the nlme package was
    customized to offer this option as well. In this            paper, we derived
    the log-likelihoods for the mixed models using a fixed residual error. By using
    some            well-known examples from mixed models, we demonstrated the equivalence
    of R and S-Plus with            respect to the estimates. The updated package
    has been accepted by the Comprehensive R Archive            Network (CRAN) team
    and will be available at the CRAN website.'

    special            experimental design. We also develop a web application with

  abstract: '  Abstract In clinical practice, it is very useful to select an optimal
    cutpoint in the scale of a continuous            biomarker or diagnostic test
    for classifying individuals as healthy or diseased. Several methods for            choosing
    optimal cutpoints have been presented in the literature, depending on the ultimate
    goal. One            of these methods, the generalized symmetry point, recently
    introduced, generalizes the symmetry            point by incorporating the misclassification
    costs. Two statistical approaches have been proposed in the            literature
    for estimating this optimal cutpoint and its associated sensitivity and specificity
    measures,            a parametric method based on the generalized pivotal quantity
    and a nonparametric method based            on empirical likelihood. In this paper,
    we introduce GsymPoint, an R package that implements these            methods
    in a user-friendly environment, allowing the end-user to calculate the generalized
    symmetry            point depending on the levels of certain categorical covariates.
    The practical use of this package is            illustrated using three real biomedical
    datasets.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Heat maps are commonly used to display the spatial distribution
    of a response observed            on a two-dimensional grid. The autoimage package
    provides convenient functions for constructing            multiple heat maps in
    unified, seamless way, particularly when working with projected coordinates.            The
    autoimage package natively supports: 1. automatic inclusion of a color scale with
    the plotted            image, 2. construction of heat maps for responses observed
    on regular or irregular grids, as well as            non-gridded data, 3. construction
    of a matrix of heat maps with a common color scale, 4. construction            of
    a matrix of heat maps with individual color scales, 5. projecting coordinates
    before plotting, 6.            easily adding geographic borders, points, and other
    features to the heat maps. After comparing the            autoimage package’s
    capabilities for constructing heat maps to those of existing tools, a carefully            selected
    set of examples is used to highlight the capabilities of the autoimage package.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces the R package that implements the Pattern
    Sequence based Forecasting            (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for
    univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been            successfully
    applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts:
    clustering            and prediction. The clustering part includes selection of
    the optimum number of clusters. It labels            time series data with reference
    to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum            window
    size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference
    to past            pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions
    to implement the PSF algorithm. It            also contains a function which automates
    all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results.            The aim
    of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its usage with minimum
    efforts.            This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package
    with their syntax. It also provides a simple            example. Finally, the
    usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets,            well-known
    time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The BayesBinMix package offers a Bayesian framework for clustering
    binary data with or            without missing values by fitting mixtures of multivariate
    Bernoulli distributions with an unknown            number of components. It allows
    the joint estimation of the number of clusters and model parameters            using
    Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Heated chains are run in parallel and accelerate
    the            convergence to the target posterior distribution. Identifiability
    issues are addressed by implementing            label switching algorithms. The
    package is demonstrated and benchmarked against the Expectation           Maximization
    algorithm using a simulation study as well as a real dataset.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Complex nonparametric models—like neural networks, random
    forests, and support vector            machines—are more common than ever in predictive
    analytics, especially when dealing with large            observational databases
    that don’t adhere to the strict assumptions imposed by traditional statistical            techniques
    (e.g., multiple linear regression which assumes linearity, homoscedasticity, and
    normality).            Unfortunately, it can be challenging to understand the
    results of such models and explain them to            management. Partial dependence
    plots offer a simple solution. Partial dependence plots are low           dimensional
    graphical renderings of the prediction function so that the relationship between
    the            outcome and predictors of interest can be more easily understood.
    These plots are especially useful in            explaining the output from black
    box models. In this paper, we introduce pdp, a general R package            for
    constructing partial dependence plots.'

  title: 'checkmate: Fast Argument Checks for Defensive R Programming'
  bibtitle: 'checkmate: Fast Argument Checks for Defensive R Programming'
  author: Michel Lang
  bibauthor: Michel Lang
  abstract: '  Abstract Dynamically typed programming languages like R allow programmers
    to write generic,            flexible and concise code and to interact with the
    language using an interactive Read-eval-print-loop            (REPL). However,
    this flexibility has its price: As the R interpreter has no information about
    the            expected variable type, many base functions automatically convert
    the input instead of raising an            exception. Unfortunately, this frequently
    leads to runtime errors deeper down the call stack which            obfuscates
    the original problem and renders debugging challenging. Even worse, unwanted conver           sions
    can remain undetected and skew or invalidate the results of a statistical analysis.
    As a resort,            assertions can be employed to detect unexpected input
    during runtime and to signal understandable            and traceable errors. The
    package checkmate provides a plethora of functions to check the type and            related
    properties of the most frequently used R objects and variable types. The package
    is mostly            written in C to avoid any unnecessary performance overhead.
    Thus, the programmer can conveniently            write concise, well-tested assertions
    which outperforms custom R code for many applications. Fur           thermore,
    checkmate simplifies writing unit tests using the framework testthat (Wickham,
    2011) by            extending it with plenty of additional expectation functions,
    and registered C routines are available            for package developers to perform
    assertions on arbitrary SEXPs (internal data structure for R objects            implemented
    as struct in C) in compiled code.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The purpose of the milr package is to analyze multiple-instance
    data. Ordinary multiple           instance data consists of many independent bags,
    and each bag is composed of several instances.            The statuses of bags
    and instances are binary. Moreover, the statuses of instances are not observed,            whereas
    the statuses of bags are observed. The functions in this package are applicable
    for analyzing            multiple-instance data, simulating data via logistic
    regression, and selecting important covariates in            the regression model.
    To this end, maximum likelihood estimation with an expectation-maximization            algorithm
    is implemented for model estimation, and a lasso penalty added to the likelihood
    function is            applied for variable selection. Additionally, an "milr"
    object is applicable to generic functions fitted,            predict and summary.
    Simulated data and a real example are given to demonstrate the features of this            package.'

    spcadjust: An R Package for Adjusting for Estimation Error
              in Control Charts
  author:
  - Axel Gandy
  - Jan Terje Kvaløy
  bibauthor: Axel Gandy and Jan Terje Kvaløy
  abstract: '  Abstract In practical applications of control charts the in-control
    state and the corresponding chart            parameters are usually estimated
    based on some past in-control data. The estimation error then            needs
    to be accounted for. In this paper we present an R package, spcadjust, which implements
    a            bootstrap based method for adjusting monitoring schemes to take into
    account the estimation error.            By bootstrapping the past data this method
    guarantees, with a certain probability, a conditional            performance of
    the chart. In spcadjust the method is implement for various types of Shewhart,            CUSUM
    and EWMA charts, various performance criteria, and both parametric and non-parametric            bootstrap
    schemes. In addition to the basic charts, charts based on linear and logistic
    regression            models for risk adjusted monitoring are included, and it
    is easy for the user to add further charts. Use            of the package is demonstrated
    by examples.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Weighted effect coding refers to a specific coding matrix
    to include factor variables in            generalised linear regression models.
    With weighted effect coding, the effect for each category            represents
    the deviation of that category from the weighted mean (which corresponds to the
    sample            mean). This technique has particularly attractive properties
    when analysing observational data, that            commonly are unbalanced. The
    wec package is introduced, that provides functions to apply weighted            effect
    coding to factor variables, and to interactions between (a.) a factor variable
    and a continuous            variable and between (b.) two factor variables.'

    Hosting Data Packages via drat: A Case Study with Hurricane

  bibauthor: G. Brooke Anderson and Dirk Eddelbuettel
  abstract: '  Abstract Data-only packages offer a way to provide extended functionality
    for other R users. However,            such packages can be large enough to exceed
    the package size limit (5 megabytes) for the Comprehen           sive R Archive
    Network (CRAN). As an alternative, large data packages can be posted to additional            repostiories
    beyond CRAN itself in a way that allows smaller code packages on CRAN to access
    and            use the data. The drat package facilitates creation and use of
    such alternative repositories and makes            it particularly simple to host
    them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on packages posted to drat            repositories
    through the use of the ‘Additonal_repositories’ field in the DESCRIPTION file.
    This paper            describes how R users can create a suite of coordinated
    packages, in which larger data packages are            hosted in an alternative
    repository created with drat, while a smaller code package that interacts with            this
    data is created that can be submitted to CRAN.'
