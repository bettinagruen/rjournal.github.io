  title: Using Web Services to Work with Geodata in R
  bibtitle: Using Web Services to Work with Geodata in R
  author: Jan-Philipp Kolb
  bibauthor: Jan-Philipp Kolb
  abstract: '  Abstract Through collaborative mapping, a massive amount of data is
    accessible. Many individuals            contribute information each day. The growing
    amount of geodata is gathered by volunteers or obtained            via crowd-sourcing.
    One outstanding example of this is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Project which            provides
    access to big data in geography. Another online mapping service that enables the
    integration            of geodata into the analysis is Google Maps. The expanding
    content and the availability of geographic            information radically changes
    the perspective on geodata (Chilton 2009). Recently many application            programming
    interfaces (APIs) have been built on OSM and Google Maps. That leads to a point
    where            it is possible to access sections of geographical information
    without the usage of a complex database            solution, especially if one
    only requires a small data section for a visualization.                 First
    tools for spatial analysis have been included in the R language very early (Bivand
    and            Gebhardt, 2000) and this development will continue to accelerate,
    underpinning a continual change.            Notably, in recent years many tools
    have been developed to enable the usage of R as a geographic            information
    system (GIS). With a GIS it is possible to process spatial data. QuantumGIS (QGIS)
    is a            free software solution for these tasks, and a user interface is
    available for this purpose. R is, therefore,            an alternative to geographic
    information systems like QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). Besides,            add-ins
    for QGIS and R-packages (RQGIS) are available, that enables the combination of
    R and QGIS            (Muenchow and Schratz 2017). It is the target of this article
    to present some of the most important            R-functionalities to download
    and process geodata from OSM and the Google Maps API. The focus of            this
    paper is on functions that enable the natural usage of these APIs.'

  abstract: '  Abstract orthoDr is a package in R that solves dimension reduction
    problems using orthogonality            constrained optimization approach. The
    package serves as a unified framework for many regression            and survival
    analysis dimension reduction models that utilize semiparametric estimating equations.            The
    main computational machinery of orthoDr is a first-order algorithm developed by
    Wen and            Yin (2012) for optimization within the Stiefel manifold. We
    implement the algorithm through Rcpp            and OpenMP for fast computation.
    In addition, we developed a general-purpose solver for such            constrained
    problems with user-specified objective functions, which works as a drop-in version
    of            optim(). The package also serves as a platform for future methodology
    developments along this line            of work.'

  bibauthor: Jonathan Kropko and Jeffrey J. Harden
  abstract: '  Abstract The Cox proportional hazards model is one of the most frequently
    used estimators in duration            (survival) analysis. Because it is estimated
    using only the observed durations’ rank ordering, typical            quantities
    of interest used to communicate results of the Cox model come from the hazard
    function            (e.g., hazard ratios or percentage changes in the hazard rate).
    These quantities are substantively vague            and difficult for many audiences
    of research to understand. We introduce a suite of methods in the R            package
    coxed to address these problems. The package allows researchers to calculate duration-based            quantities
    from Cox model results, such as the expected duration (or survival time) given
    covariate            values and marginal changes in duration for a specified change
    in a covariate. These duration-based            quantities often match better
    with researchers’ substantive interests and are easily understood by most            readers.
    We describe the methods and illustrate use of the package.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The bayesdfa package provides a flexible Bayesian modeling
    framework for applying dy           namic factor analysis (DFA) to multivariate
    time-series data as a dimension reduction tool. The core            estimation
    is done with the Stan probabilistic programming language. In addition to being
    one of the            few Bayesian implementations of DFA, novel features of this
    model include (1) optionally modeling            latent process deviations as
    drawn from a Student-t distribution to better model extremes, and (2)            optionally
    including autoregressive and moving-average components in the latent trends. Besides            estimation,
    we provide a series of plotting functions to visualize trends, loadings, and model
    pre           dicted values. A secondary analysis for some applications is to
    identify regimes in latent trends. We            provide a flexible Bayesian implementation
    of a Hidden Markov Model — also written with Stan — to            characterize
    regime shifts in latent processes. We provide simulation testing and details on
    parameter            sensitivities in supplementary information.'

  abstract: ' Abstract Biclustering is a statistical learning technique that attempts
    to find homogeneous partitions           of rows and columns of a data matrix.
    For example, movie ratings might be biclustered to group both           raters
    and movies. biclust is a current R package allowing users to implement a variety
    of biclustering           algorithms. However, its algorithms do not allow the
    data matrix to have missing values. We provide           a new R package, biclustermd,
    which allows users to perform biclustering on numeric data even in           the
    presence of missing values.'

  abstract: '  Abstract                  Machine learning models have successfully
    been applied to challenges in applied in biology,            medicine, finance,
    physics, and other fields. With modern software it is easy to train even a complex            model
    that fits the training data and results in high accuracy on test set. However,
    problems often            arise when models are confronted with the real-world
    data. This paper describes methodology and            tools for model-agnostic
    auditing. It provides functinos for assessing and comparing the goodness of            fit
    and performance of models. In addition, the package may be used for analysis of
    the similarity of            residuals and for identification of outliers and
    influential observations. The examination is carried out            by diagnostic
    scores and visual verification. The code presented in this paper are implemented

  abstract: '  Abstract Researchers and data-analysts often use the linear regression
    model for descriptive, predictive,            and inferential purposes. This model
    relies on a set of assumptions that, when not satisfied, yields            biased
    results and noisy estimates. A common problem that can be solved in many ways
    – use of less            restrictive methods (e.g. generalized linear regression
    models or non-parametric methods ), variance            corrections or transformations
    of the response variable just to name a few. We focus on the latter            option
    as it allows to keep using the simple and well-known linear regression model.
    The list of            transformations proposed in the literature is long and
    varies according to the problem they aim to            solve. Such diversity can
    leave analysts lost and confused. We provide a framework implemented            as
    an R-package, trafo, to help select suitable transformations depending on the
    user requirements            and data being analyzed. The package trafo contains
    a collection of selected transformations and            estimation methods that
    complement and increase the breadth of methods that exist in R.'

  bibauthor: Wadim Djatschenko
  abstract: '  Abstract The purpose of this paper is to introduce the R package BondValuation
    for the analysis of            large datasets of fixed coupon bonds. The conceptual
    heterogeneity of fixed coupon bonds traded            in the global markets imposes
    a high degree of complexity on their comparative analysis. Contrary            to
    baseline fixed income theory, in practice, most bonds feature coupon period irregularities.
    In            addition, there are a multitude of day count methods that determine
    the interest accrual, the cash            flows and the discount factors used
    in bond valuation. Several R packages, e.g., fBonds, RQuantLib,            and
    YieldCurve, provide tools for fixed income analysis. Nevertheless, none of them
    is capable            of evaluating bonds featuring irregular first and/or final
    coupon periods, and neither provides            adequate coverage of day count
    conventions currently used in the global bond markets. The R package            BondValuation
    closes this gap using the generalized valuation methodology presented in Djatschenko            (2019).'

  bibauthor: David P. Hofmeyr and Nicos G. Pavlidis
  abstract: '  Abstract This paper presents the R package PPCI which implements three
    recently proposed projec           tion pursuit methods for clustering. The methods
    are unified by the approach of defining an optimal            hyperplane to separate
    clusters, and deriving a projection index whose optimiser is the vector normal            to
    this separating hyperplane. Divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms that can
    detect clusters            defined in different subspaces are readily obtained
    by recursively bi-partitioning the data through such            hyperplanes. Projecting
    onto the vector normal to the optimal hyperplane enables visualisations of the            data
    that can be used to validate the partition at each level of the cluster hierarchy.
    Clustering models            can also be modified in an interactive manner to
    improve their solutions. Extensions to problems            involving clusters
    which are not linearly separable, and to the problem of finding maximum hard            margin
    hyperplanes for clustering are also discussed.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The 4 Parameter Logistic (4PL) model has been recognized as
    a major tool to analyze the            relationship between doses and responses
    in pharmacological experiments. A main strength of this            model is that
    each parameter contributes an intuitive meaning enhancing interpretability of
    a fitted            model. However, implementing the 4PL model using conventional
    statistical software often encounters            numerical errors. This paper
    highlights the issue of convergence failure and presents several causes            with
    solutions. These causes include outliers and a non-logistic data shape, so useful
    remedies such            as robust estimation, outlier diagnostics and constrained
    optimization are proposed. These features            are implemented in a new
    R package dr4pl (Dose-Response analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic            model)
    whose code examples are presented as a separate section. Our R package dr4pl is

  abstract: '  Abstract The cluster randomized trial (CRT) is a randomized controlled
    trial in which randomization is            conducted at the cluster level (e.g.,
    school or hospital) and outcomes are measured for each individual            within
    a cluster. Often, the number of clusters available to randomize is small (≤ 20),
    which increases            the chance of baseline covariate imbalance between
    comparison arms. Such imbalance is particularly            problematic when the
    covariates are predictive of the outcome because it can threaten the internal            validity
    of the CRT. Pair-matching and stratification are two restricted randomization
    approaches            that are frequently used to ensure balance at the design
    stage. An alternative, less commonly-used            restricted randomization
    approach is covariate-constrained randomization. Covariate-constrained            randomization
    quantifies baseline imbalance of cluster-level covariates using a balance metric
    and            randomly selects a randomization scheme from those with acceptable

    both categorical and continuous. To facilitate imple           mentation of covariate-constrained
    randomization for the design of two-arm parallel CRTs, we have            developed
    the cvcrand R package. In addition, cvcrand also implements the clustered permutation            test
    for analyzing continuous and binary outcomes collected from a CRT designed with
    covariate           constrained randomization. We used a real cluster randomized
    trial to illustrate the functions included            in the package.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Multiple imputation is a tool for parameter estimation and
    inference with partially observed            data, which is used increasingly
    widely in medical and social research. When the data to be imputed            are
    correlated or have a multilevel structure — repeated observations on patients,
    school children            nested in classes within schools within educational
    districts — the imputation model needs to include            this structure. Here
    we introduce our joint modelling package for multiple imputation of multilevel            data,
    jomo, which uses a multivariate normal model fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    (MCMC).            Compared to previous packages for multilevel imputation, e.g.
    pan, jomo adds the facility to (i) handle            and impute categorical variables
    using a latent normal structure, (ii) impute level-2 variables, and (iii)            allow
    for cluster-specific covariance matrices, including the option to give them an
    inverse-Wishart            distribution at level 2. The package uses C routines
    to speed up the computations and has been            extensively validated in
    simulation studies both by ourselves and others.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The gold standard of experimental research is the randomized
    control trial. However,            interventions are often implemented without
    a randomized control group for practical or ethical            reasons. Propensity
    score matching (PSM) is a popular method for minimizing the effects of a            randomized
    experiment from observational data by matching members of a treatment group to
    similar            candidates that did not receive the intervention. Traditional
    PSM is not designed for studies that enroll            participants on a rolling
    basis and does not provide a solution for interventions in which the baseline            and
    intervention period are undefined in the comparison group. Rolling Entry Matching
    (REM) is a            new matching method that addresses both issues. REM selects
    comparison members who are similar            to intervention members with respect
    to both static (e.g., race) and dynamic (e.g., health conditions)            characteristics.
    This paper will discuss the key components of REM and introduce the rollmatch
    R            package.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Several methods for creating classifiers based on rules discovered
    via association rule            mining have been proposed in the literature. These
    classifiers are called associative classifiers and            the best-known algorithm
    is Classification Based on Associations (CBA). Interestingly, only very few            implementations
    are available and, until recently, no implementation was available for R. Now,
    three            packages provide CBA. This paper introduces associative classification,
    the CBA algorithm, and how            it can be used in R. A comparison of the
    three packages is provided to give the potential user an idea            about
    the advantages of each of the implementations. We also show how the packages are
    related to            the existing infrastructure for association rule mining
    already available in R.'

  author:

  bibauthor: John R. Giles and Henrik Salje and Justin Lessler
  abstract: '  Abstract Spatial statistics for infectious diseases are important because
    the spatial and temporal            scale over which transmission operates determine
    the dynamics of disease spread. Many methods            for quantifying the distribution
    and clustering of spatial point patterns have been developed (e.g. K           function
    and pair correlation function) and are routinely applied to infectious disease
    case occurrence            data. However, these methods do not explicitly account
    for overlapping chains of transmission and            require knowledge of the
    underlying population distribution, which can be limiting when analyzing            epidemic
    case occurrence data. Therefore, we developed two novel spatial statistics that
    account for            these effects to estimate: 1) the mean of the spatial transmission
    kernel, and 2) the τ-statistic, a measure            of global clustering based
    on pathogen subtype. We briefly introduce these statistics and show how to            implement
    them using the IDSpatialStats R package.'

    Comparing namedCapture with other R packages for regular

  author: Toby Dylan Hocking

  abstract: '  Abstract Regular expressions are powerful tools for manipulating non-tabular

    tables of numbers must be extracted from such data before            processing

    expressions in R code. We begin by            describing the history of regular
    expressions and their usage in R. We then describe the new features of            the

  abstract: '  Abstract The increasing availability of large but noisy data sets with
    a large number of heterogeneous            variables leads to the increasing interest
    in the automation of common tasks for data analysis. The            most time-consuming
    part of this process is the Exploratory Data Analysis, crucial for better domain            understanding,
    data cleaning, data validation, and feature engineering.                  There
    is a growing number of libraries that attempt to automate some of the typical
    Exploratory            Data Analysis tasks to make the search for new insights
    easier and faster. In this paper, we present a            systematic review of
    existing tools for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (autoEDA). We explore            the
    features of fifteen popular R packages to identify the parts of analysis that
    can be effectively            automated with the current tools and to point out
    new directions for further autoEDA development.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Nonparametric statistical inference methods for a modern and
    robust analysis of longitudinal            and multivariate data in factorial
    experiments are essential for research. While existing approaches            that
    rely on specific distributional assumptions of the data (multivariate normality
    and/or equal            covariance matrices) are implemented in statistical software
    packages, there is a need for user-friendly            software that can be used
    for the analysis of data that do not fulfill the aforementioned assumptions            and
    provide accurate p value and confidence interval estimates. Therefore, newly developed
    nonpara           metric statistical methods based on bootstrapand permutation-approaches,
    which neither assume            multivariate normality nor specific covariance
    matrices, have been implemented in the freely available            R package MANOVA.RM.
    The package is equipped with a graphical user interface for plausible            applications

  author: Philipp Otto
  bibauthor: Philipp Otto
  abstract: ' Abstract In this paper, a general overview on spatial and spatiotemporal
    ARCH models is provided.           In particular, we distinguish between three
    different spatial ARCH-type models. In addition to           the original definition
    of ?, we introduce an logarithmic spatial ARCH model in this paper. For           this
    new model, maximum-likelihood estimators for the parameters are proposed. In addition,
    we           consider a new complex-valued definition of the spatial ARCH process.
    Moreover, spatial GARCH           models are briefly discussed. From a practical
    point of view, the use of the R-package spGARCH is           demonstrated. To
    be precise, we show how the proposed spatial ARCH models can be simulated           and
    summarize the variety of spatial models, which can be estimated by the estimation
    functions           provided in the package. Eventually, we apply all procedures
