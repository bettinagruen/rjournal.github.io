  abstract: '  Abstract Any shape that is drawn using the grid graphics package can
    have a name associated            with it. If a name is provided, it is possible
    to access, query, and modify the shape after it has been            drawn. These
    facilities allow for very detailed customisations of plots and also for very general            transformations
    of plots that are drawn by packages based on grid.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The R graphics engine has new support for drawing complex
    paths via the functions            polypath() and grid.path(). This article explains
    what is meant by a complex path and demonstrates            the usefulness of
    complex paths in drawing non-trivial shapes, logos, customised data symbols, and            maps.                 One
    of the design goals of the R graphics system is to allow fine control over the
    small details            of plots. One way that the R graphics system does this
    is by providing access to low-level generic            graphics facilities, such
    as the ability to draw basic shapes and the ability to control apparently esoteric,            but
    still useful, features of those shapes, such as the line end style used for drawing
    lines.                 In R version 2.12.0, another low-level graphics facility
    was added to R: the ability to draw complex            paths (not just polygons).                 This
    article describes this new facility and presents some examples that show how complex
    paths            might be useful.'

  abstract: '  Abstract A graphical scene that has been produced using the grid graphics
    package consists of grobs            (graphical objects) and viewports. This article
    describes functions that allow the exploration and            inspection of the
    grobs and viewports in a grid scene, including several functions that are available
    in            a new package called gridDebug. The ability to explore the grobs
    and viewports in a grid scene is            useful for adding more drawing to
    a scene that was produced using grid and for understanding and            debugging
    the grid code that produced a scene.'

  abstract: '   Abstract We present the frailtyHL package for fitting semi-parametric
    frailty models using h            likelihood. This package allows lognormal or
    gamma frailties for random-effect distribution, and it             fits shared
    or multilevel frailty models for correlated survival data. Functions are provided
    to format             and summarize the frailtyHL results. The estimates of fixed
    effects and frailty parameters and their             standard errors are calculated.
    We illustrate the use of our package with three well-known data sets             and
    compare our results with various alternative R-procedures.'

  abstract: '  Abstract influence.ME provides tools for detecting influential data
    in mixed effects models. The            application of these models has become
    common practice, but the development of diagnostic tools            has lagged
    behind. influence.ME calculates standardized measures of influential data for
    the point            estimates of generalized mixed effects models, such as DFBETAS,
    Cook’s distance, as well as percentile            change and a test for changing
    levels of significance. influence.ME calculates these measures of            influence
    while accounting for the nesting structure of the data. The package and measures
    of            influential data are introduced, a practical example is given, and
    strategies for dealing with influential            data are suggested.                 The
    application of mixed effects regression models has become common practice in the
    field of            social sciences. As used in the social sciences, mixed effects
    regression models take into account            that observations on individual
    respondents are nested within higher-level groups such as schools,            classrooms,
    states, and countries (Snijders and Bosker, 1999), and are often referred to as
    multilevel            regression models. Despite these models’ increasing popularity,
    diagnostic tools to evaluate fitted            models lag behind.                 We
    introduce influence.ME (Nieuwenhuis, Pelzer, and te Grotenhuis, 2012), an R-package
    that            provides tools for detecting influential cases in mixed effects
    regression models estimated with lme4            (Bates and Maechler, 2010). It
    is commonly accepted that tests for influential data should be performed            on
    regression models, especially when estimates are based on a relatively small number
    of cases.            However, most existing procedures do not account for the
    nesting structure of the data. As a result,            these existing procedures
    fail to detect that higher-level cases may be influential on estimates of            variables
    measured at specifically that level.                 In this paper, we outline
    the basic rationale on detecting influential data, describe standardized            measures
    of influence, provide a practical example of the analysis of students in 23 schools,
    and            discuss strategies for dealing with influential cases. Testing
    for influential cases in mixed effects            regression models is important,
    because influential data negatively influence the statistical fit and            generalizability
    of the model. In social science applications of mixed models the testing for influential            data
    is especially important, since these models are frequently based on large numbers
    of observations            at the individual level while the number of higher
    level groups is relatively small. For instance, Van der            Meer, te Grotenhuis,
    and Pelzer (2010) were unable to find any country-level comparative studies            involving
    more than 54 countries. With such a relatively low number of countries, a single
    country can            easily be overly influential on the parameter estimates
    of one or more of the country-level variables.'

  abstract: '  Abstract A new package crs is introduced for computing nonparametric
    regression (and quantile)            splines in the presence of both continuous
    and categorical predictors. B-splines are employed in the            regression
    model for the continuous predictors and kernel weighting is employed for the categorical            predictors.
    We also develop a simple R interface to NOMAD, which is a mixed integer optimization            solver
    used to compute optimal regression spline solutions.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In the nineteen seventies, Jurečková and Jaeckel proposed
    rank estimation for linear models.            Since that time, several authors
    have developed inference and diagnostic methods for these estimators.            These
    rank-based estimators and their associated inference are highly efficient and
    are robust to            outliers in response space. The methods include estimation
    of standard errors, tests of general linear            hypotheses, confidence
    intervals, diagnostic procedures including studentized residuals, and measures            of
    influential cases. We have developed an R package, Rfit, for computing of these
    robust procedures.            In this paper we highlight the main features of
    the package. The package uses standard linear model            syntax and includes
    many of the main inference and diagnostic functions.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In this paper we provide a short tutorial illustrating the
    new functions in the package ggm            that deal with ancestral, summary
    and ribbonless graphs. These are mixed graphs (containing three            types
    of edges) that are important because they capture the modified independence structure
    after            marginalisation over, and conditioning on, nodes of directed
    acyclic graphs. We provide functions to            verify whether a mixed graph
    implies that A is independent of B given C for any disjoint sets of nodes            and
    to generate maximal graphs inducing the same independence structure of non-maximal
    graphs.            Finally, we provide functions to decide on the Markov equivalence
    of two graphs with the same node            set but different types of edges.'

  title: The State of Naming Conventions in R

  abstract: '  Abstract Most programming language communities have naming conventions
    that are generally            agreed upon, that is, a set of rules that governs
    how functions and variables are named. This is not the            case with R,
    and a review of unofficial style guides and naming convention usage on CRAN shows            that
    a number of different naming conventions are currently in use. Some naming conventions
    are,            however, more popular than others and as a newcomer to the R community
    or as a developer of a new            package this could be useful to consider
    when choosing what naming convention to adopt.'
