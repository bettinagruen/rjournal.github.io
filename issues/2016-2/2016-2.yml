  abstract: '  Abstract Reuse of controls from nested case-control designs can increase
    efficiency in many situations,            for instance with competing risks or
    in other multiple endpoints situations. The matching between            cases
    and controls must be broken when controls are to be used for other endpoints.
    A weighted            analysis can then be performed to take care of the biased
    sampling from the cohort. We present the            R package multipleNCC for
    reuse of controls in nested case-control studies by inverse probability            weighting
    of the partial likelihood. The package handles right-censored, left-truncated
    and additionally            matched data, and varying numbers of sampled controls
    and the whole analysis is carried out using            one simple command. Four
    weight estimators are presented and variance estimation is explained.            The
    package is illustrated by analyzing health survey data from three counties in
    Norway for two            causes of death: cardiovascular disease and death from
    alcohol abuse, liver disease, and accidents and            violence. The data
    set is included in the package.'

  abstract: '  Abstract QPot (pronounced kyoo + p ät) is an R package for analyzing
    two-dimensional systems of            stochastic differential equations. It provides
    users with a wide range of tools to simulate, analyze,            and visualize
    the dynamics of these systems. One of QPot’s key features is the computation of
    the            quasi-potential, an important tool for studying stochastic systems.
    Quasi-potentials are particularly            useful for comparing the relative
    stabilities of equilibria in systems with alternative stable states. This            paper
    describes QPot’s primary functions, and explains how quasi-potentials can yield
    insights about            the dynamics of stochastic systems. Three worked examples
    guide users through the application of            QPot’s functions.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Models of cancer progression provide insights on the order
    of accumulation of genetic            alterations during cancer development. Algorithms
    to infer such models from the currently available            mutational profiles
    collected from different cancer patients (cross-sectional data) have been defined
    in            the literature since late the 90s. These algorithms differ in the
    way they extract a graphical model of the            events modelling the progression,
    e.g., somatic mutations or copy-number alterations.                  TRONCO is
    an R package for TRanslational ONcology which provides a series of functions            to
    assist the user in the analysis of cross-sectional genomic data and, in particular,
    it implements            algorithms that aim to model cancer progression by means
    of the notion of selective advantage. These            algorithms are proved to
    outperform the current state-of-the-art in the inference of cancer progression            models.
    TRONCO also provides functionalities to load input cross-sectional data, set up
    the execution            of the algorithms, assess the statistical confidence
    in the results, and visualize the models.            Availability. Freely available

  abstract: '  Abstract The package diverse provides an easy-to-use interface to calculate
    and visualize different            aspects of diversity in complex systems. In
    recent years, an increasing number of research projects in            social and
    interdisciplinary sciences, including fields like innovation studies, scientometrics,
    economics,            and network science have emphasized the role of diversification
    and sophistication of socioeconomic            systems. However, so far no dedicated
    package exists that covers the needs of these emerging fields            and interdisciplinary
    teams. Most packages about diversity tend to be created according to the            demands
    and terminology of particular areas of natural and biological sciences. The package
    diverse            uses interdisciplinary concepts of diversity—like variety,
    disparity and balance— as well as ubiquity            and revealed comparative
    advantages, that are relevant to many fields of science, but are in particular            useful
    for interdisciplinary research on diversity in socioeconomic systems. The package
    diverse            provides a toolkit for social scientists, interdisciplinary
    researcher, and beginners in ecology to (i)            import data, (ii) calculate
    different data transformations and normalization like revealed comparative            advantages,
    (iii) calculate different diversity measures, and (iv) connect diverse to other
    specialized R            packages on similarity measures, data visualization techniques,
    and statistical significance tests. The            comprehensiveness of the package,
    from matrix import and transformations options, over similarity            and
    diversity measures, to data visualization methods, makes it a useful package to
    explore different            dimensions of diversity in complex systems.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We developed the R package SimCorMultRes to facilitate simulation
    of correlated categori           cal (binary and multinomial) responses under
    a desired marginal model specification. The simulated            correlated categorical
    responses are obtained by applying threshold approaches to correlated contin           uous
    responses of underlying regression models and the dependence structure is parametrized
    in            terms of the correlation matrix of the latent continuous responses.
    This article provides an elaborate            introduction to the SimCorMultRes
    package demonstrating its design and usage via three examples.            The

  abstract: '  Abstract Social scientists and statisticians often use aggregate data
    to predict individual-level behavior            because the latter are not always
    available. Various statistical techniques have been developed to            make
    inferences from one level (e.g., precinct) to another level (e.g., individual
    voter) that minimize            errors associated with ecological inference. While
    ecological inference has been shown to be highly            problematic in a wide
    array of scientific fields, many political scientists and analysis employ the            techniques
    when studying voting patterns. Indeed, federal voting rights lawsuits now require
    such            an analysis, yet expert reports are not consistent in which type
    of ecological inference is used. This            is especially the case in the
    analysis of racially polarized voting when there are multiple candidates            and
    multiple racial groups. The eiCompare package was developed to easily assess two
    of the more            common ecological inference methods: EI and EI:R×C. The
    package facilitates a seamless comparison            between these methods so
    that scholars and legal practitioners can easily assess the two methods and            whether
    they produce similar or disparate findings.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The UK National River Flow Archive (NRFA) stores several types
    of hydrological data and            metadata: daily river flow and catchment rainfall
    time series, gauging station and catchment informa           tion. Data are served
    through the NRFA web services via experimental RESTful APIs. Obtaining NRFA            data
    can be unwieldy due to complexities in handling HTTP GET requests and parsing
    responses in            JSON and XML formats. The rnrfa package provides a set

    data,            respectively. Visualization examples are also provided with a
    shiny web application and functions            provided in the package. Although

  landing: '2016'
  abstract: '  Abstract Quantiles play a fundamental role in statistics. The quantile
    function defines the distribution            of a random variable and, thus, provides
    a way to describe the data that is specular but equivalent            to that
    given by the corresponding cumulative distribution function. There are many advantages
    in            working with quantiles, starting from their properties. The renewed
    interest in their usage seen in the            last years is due to the theoretical,
    methodological, and software contributions that have broadened            their
    applicability. This paper presents the R package Qtools, a collection of utilities
    for unconditional            and conditional quantiles.'

  landing: '2016'
  abstract: '  Abstract In analyzing data deriving from the administration of a questionnaire
    to a group of individu           als, Item Response Theory (IRT) models provide
    a flexible framework to account for several aspects            involved in the
    response process, such as the existence of multiple latent traits. In this paper,
    we focus            on a class of semi-parametric multidimensional IRT models,
    in which these traits are represented            through one or more discrete
    latent variables; these models allow us to cluster individuals into homo           geneous
    latent classes and, at the same time, to properly study item characteristics.
    In particular, we            follow a within-item multidimensional formulation
    similar to that adopted in the two-tier models,            with each item measuring
    one or two latent traits. The proposed class of models may be estimated            through
    the package MLCIRTwithin, whose functioning is illustrated in this paper with
    examples            based on data about quality-of-life measurement and about
    the propensity to commit a crime.'

    the classical            approach to (symmetrical) correspondence analysis, singly

    non symmetrical correspondence analysis, singly ordered non            symmetrical

  abstract: '  Abstract ROC curve analysis is a fundamental tool for evaluating the
    performance of a marker in a            number of research areas, e.g., biomedicine,
    bioinformatics, engineering etc., and is frequently used            for discriminating
    cases from controls. There are a number of analysis tools which are used to guide            researchers
    through their analysis. Some of these tools are commercial and provide basic methods            for
    ROC curve analysis while others offer advanced analysis techniques and a command-based
    user            interface, such as the R environment. The R environmentg includes
    comprehensive tools for ROC curve            analysis; however, using a command-based
    interface might be challenging and time consuming when a            quick evaluation
    is desired; especially for non-R users, physicians etc. Hence, a quick, comprehensive,            free
    and easy-to-use analysis tool is required. For this purpose, we developed a user-friendly
    web           tool based on the R language. This tool provides ROC statistics,
    graphical tools, optimal cutpoint            calculation, comparison of several
    markers, and sample size estimation to support researchers in their            decisions
    without writing R codes. easyROC can be used via any device with an internet connection            independently
    of the operating system. The web interface of easyROC is constructed with the
    R            package shiny. This tool is freely available through www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC.'

  abstract: '  Abstract TIGER/Line shapefiles from the United States Census Bureau
    are commonly used for the            mapping and analysis of US demographic trends.
    The tigris package provides a uniform interface            for R users to download

    geographic datasets using familiar geographic identifiers and return those datasets

  abstract: '  Abstract Kernel estimation is an important technique in exploratory
    data analysis. Its utility relies            on its ease of interpretation, especially
    based on graphical means. The Ake package is introduced            for univariate
    density or probability mass function estimation and also for continuous and discrete            regression
    functions using associated kernel estimators. These associated kernels have been
    proposed            due to their specific features of variables of interest. The
    package focuses on associated kernel methods            appropriate for continuous
    (bounded, positive) or discrete (count, categorical) data often found in            applied
    settings. Furthermore, optimal bandwidths are selected by cross-validation for
    any associated            kernel and by Bayesian methods for the binomial kernel.
    Other Bayesian methods for selecting            bandwidths with other associated
    kernels will complete this package in its future versions; particularly,            a
    Bayesian adaptive method for gamma kernel estimation of density functions is developed.
    Some            practical and theoretical aspects of the normalizing constant
    in both density and probability mass            functions estimations are given.'

    and predictive data            mining. Nowadays it is very relevant for researchers

    For this task, evolutionary fuzzy systems are well suited algorithms            because
    they can find a good trade-off between multiple objectives in large search spaces.
    In fact, this            paper presents the SDEFSR package, which contains all
    the evolutionary fuzzy systems for subgroup            discovery presented throughout
    the literature. It is a package without dependencies on other software,            providing
    functions with recommended default parameters. In addition, it brings a graphical

  abstract: '  Abstract The crop water requirement is a key factor in the agricultural
    process. It is usually estimated            throughout actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa ). This parameter is the key to develop irrigation strategies,            to
    improve water use efficiency and to understand hydrological, climatic, and ecosystem
    processes.            Currently, it is calculated with classical methods, which
    are difficult to extrapolate, or with land surface            energy balance models
    (LSEB), such as METRIC and SEBAL, which are based on remote sensing data.            This
    paper describes water, an open implementation of LSEB. The package provides several
    functions            to estimate the parameters of the LSEB equation from satellite
    data and proposes a new object class            to handle weather station data.
    One of the critical steps in METRIC is the selection of “cold” and           “hot”
    pixels, which water solves with an automatic method. The water package can process
    a batch            of satellite images and integrates most of the already published
    sub-models for METRIC. Although            water implements METRIC, it will be
    expandable to SEBAL and others in the near future. Finally, two            different
    procedures are demonstrated using data that is included in water package.'

    a general framework of curve fitting, mixture experimental design, and mixture
    toxicity            prediction for practitioners in toxicology. The unique features
    of mixtox include: (1) constructing a            uniform table for mixture experimental
    design; and (2) predicting toxicity of a mixture with multiple            components
    based on reference models such as concentration addition, independent action,
    and            generalized concentration addition. We describe the various functions
    of the package and provide            examples to illustrate their use and show
    the collaboration of mixtox with other existing packages            (e.g., drc)
    in predicting toxicity of chemical mixtures.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The WeDiBaDis package provides a user friendly environment
    to perform discriminant            analysis (supervised classification). WeDiBaDis
    is an easy to use package addressed to the biological            and medical communities,
    and in general, to researchers interested in applied studies. It can be            suitable
    when the user is interested in the problem of constructing a discriminant rule
    on the basis            of distances between a relatively small number of instances
    or units of known unbalanced-class            membership measured on many (possibly
    thousands) features of any type. This is a current situation            when analyzing
    genetic biomedical data. This discriminant rule can then be used both, as a means
    of            explaining differences among classes, but also in the important
    task of assigning the class membership            for new unlabeled units. Our
    package implements two discriminant analysis procedures in an R            environment:
    the well-known distance-based discriminant analysis (DB-discriminant) and a weighted           distance-based
    discriminant (WDB-discriminant), a novel classifier rule that we introduce. This
    new            procedure is based on an improvement of the DB rule taking into
    account the statistical depth of the            units. This article presents both
    classifying procedures and describes the implementation of each in            detail.
    We illustrate the use of the package using an ecological and a genetic experimental
    example.            Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the new proposed
    procedure (WDB), as compared with DB.            This comparison is carried out
    using thirty-eight, high-dimensional, class-unbalanced, cancer data            sets,
    three of which include clinical features.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The definition of a distance measure between time series is
    crucial for many time series data            mining tasks, such as clustering
    and classification. For this reason, a vast portfolio of time series            distance
    measures has been published in the past few years. In this paper, the TSdist package
    is            presented, a complete tool which provides a unified framework to
    calculate the largest variety of            time series dissimilarity measures
    available in R at the moment, to the best of our knowledge. The            package
    implements some popular distance measures which were not previously available
    in R, and            moreover, it also provides wrappers for measures already
    included in other R packages. Additionally,            the application of these
    distance measures to clustering and classification tasks is also supported            in
    TSdist, directly enabling the evaluation and comparison of their performance within
    these two            frameworks.'

  abstract: '  Abstract One major goal in clinical applications of time-to-event data
    is the estimation of survival            with censored data. The usual nonparametric
    estimator of the survival function is the time-honored            Kaplan-Meier
    product-limit estimator. Though this estimator has been implemented in several
    R            packages, the development of the condSURV R package has been motivated
    by recent contributions            that allow the estimation of the survival function
    for ordered multivariate failure time data. The            condSURV package provides
    three different approaches all based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator.            In
    one of these approaches these quantities are estimated conditionally on current
    or past covariate            measures. Illustration of the software usage is included
    using real data.'

  abstract: ' Abstract We briefly review SI units, and discuss R packages that deal
    with measurement units,           their compatibility and conversion. Built upon
    udunits2 and the UNIDATA udunits library, we           introduce the package units
    that provides a class for maintaining unit metadata. When used in           expression,
    it automatically converts units, and simplifies units of results when possible;
    in case of           incompatible units, errors are raised. The class flexibly
    allows expansion beyond predefined units.           Using units may eliminate
    a whole class of potential scientific programming mistakes. We discuss           the
    potential and limitations of computing with explicit units.'

  abstract: '  Abstract It is common for linear regression models to be plagued with
    the problem of multicollinearity            when two or more regressors are highly
    correlated. This problem results in unstable estimates of            regression
    coefficients and causes some serious problems in validation and interpretation
    of the model.            Different diagnostic measures are used to detect multicollinearity
    among regressors. Many statistical            software and R packages provide
    few diagnostic measures for the judgment of multicollinearity. Most            widely
    used diagnostic measures in these software are: coefficient of determination (R2
    ), variance            inflation factor/tolerance limit (VIF/TOL), eigenvalues,
    condition number (CN) and condition index            (CI) etc. In this manuscript,
    we present an R package, mctest, that computes popular and widely used            multicollinearity
    diagnostic measures. The package also indicates which regressors may be the reason            of
    collinearity among regressors.'
