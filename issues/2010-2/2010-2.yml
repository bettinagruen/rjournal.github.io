  abstract: Although R is still predominantly applied for statistical analysis and
    graphical representation, it is rapidly becoming more suitable for mathematical
    computing. One of the fields where considerable progress has been made recently
    is the solution of differential equations. Here we give a brief overview of differential
    equations that can now be solved by R.

  abstract: '  Abstract We present the hglm package for fitting hierarchical generalized
    linear models. It can be            used for linear mixed models and generalized
    linear mixed models with random effects for a variety            of links and
    a variety of distributions for both the outcomes and the random effects. Fixed
    effects can            also be fitted in the dispersion part of the model.'

  abstract: '  Abstract String processing is not glamorous, but it is frequently used
    in data cleaning and preparation.            The existing string functions in
    R are powerful, but not friendly. To remedy this, the stringr package            provides
    string functions that are simpler and more consistent, and also fixes some functionality
    that            R is missing compared to other programming languages.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This note presents the R package bayesGARCH which provides
    functions for the Bayesian            estimation of the parsimonious and effective
    GARCH(1,1) model with Student-t innovations. The            estimation procedure
    is fully automatic and thus avoids the tedious task of tuning an MCMC sampling            algorithm.
    The usage of the package is shown in an empirical application to exchange rate
    log-returns.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Graphical processing units are rapidly gaining maturity as
    powerful general parallel comput           ing devices. The package cudaBayesreg
    uses GPU–oriented procedures to improve the performance            of Bayesian
    computations. The paper motivates the need for devising high-performance computing            strategies
    in the context of fMRI data analysis. Some features of the package for Bayesian
    analysis of            brain fMRI data are illustrated. Comparative computing
    performance figures between sequential and            parallel implementations
    are presented as well.'

  abstract: '  Abstract When the prevalence of a disease or of some other binary characteristic
    is small, group            testing (also known as pooled testing) is frequently
    used to estimate the prevalence and/or to identify            individuals as positive
    or negative. We have developed the binGroup package as the first package            designed
    to address the estimation problem in group testing. We present functions to estimate
    an            overall prevalence for a homogeneous population. Also, for this
    setting, we have functions to aid in            the very important choice of the
    group size. When individuals come from a heterogeneous population,            our
    group testing regression functions can be used to estimate an individual probability
    of disease            positivity by using the group observations only. We illustrate
    our functions with data from a multiple            vector transfer design experiment
    and a human infectious disease prevalence study.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Record linkage deals with detecting homonyms and mainly synonyms
    in data. The package            RecordLinkage provides means to perform and evaluate
    different record linkage methods. A stochas           tic framework is implemented
    which calculates weights through an EM algorithm. The determination            of
    the necessary thresholds in this model can be achieved by tools of extreme value
    theory. Further           more, machine learning methods are utilized, including
    decision trees (rpart), bootstrap aggregating            (bagging), ada boost
    (ada), neural nets (nnet) and support vector machines (svm). The generation            of
    record pairs and comparison patterns from single data items are provided as well.
    Comparison            patterns can be chosen to be binary or based on some string
    metrics. In order to reduce computation            time and memory usage, blocking
    can be used. Future development will concentrate on additional            and
    refined methods, performance improvements and input/output facilities needed for
    real-world            application.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Weighted generalized ridge regression offers unique advantages
    in correlated high-dimensional            problems. Such estimators can be efficiently
    computed using Bayesian spike and slab models and are            effective for
    prediction. For sparse variable selection, a generalization of the elastic net
    can be used in            tandem with these Bayesian estimates. In this article,
    we describe the R-software package spikeslab            for implementing this
    new spike and slab prediction and variable selection methodology.'
