  abstract: '  Abstract The Method of Anchored Distributions (MAD) is a method for
    Bayesian inversion designed            for inferring both local (e.g. point values)
    and global properties (e.g. mean and variogram parameters)            of spatially
    heterogenous fields using multi-type and multi-scale data. Software implementations            of
    MAD exist in C++ and C# to import data, execute an ensemble of forward model simulations,            and
    perform basic post-processing of calculating likelihood and posterior distributions
    for a given            application. This article describes the R package anchoredDistr
    that has been built to provide an R           based environment for this method.
    In particular, anchoredDistr provides a range of post-processing            capabilities
    for MAD software by taking advantage of the statistical capabilities and wide
    use of the            R language. Two examples from stochastic hydrogeology are
    provided to highlight the features of            the package for MAD applications
    in inferring anchored distributions of local parameters (e.g. point            values
    of transmissivity) as well as global parameters (e.g. the mean of the spatial
    random function for            hydraulic conductivity).'

              Features in High Dimensional Data

  bibauthor: Nicolae Teodor Melita and Stefan Holban
  abstract: '  Abstract The dGAselID package proposes an original approach to feature
    selection in high dimen           sional data. The method is built upon a diploid
    genetic algorithm. The genotype to phenotype            mapping is modeled after
    the Incomplete Dominance Inheritance, overpassing the necessity to define            a
    dominance scheme. The fitness evaluation is done by user selectable supervised
    classifiers, from a            broad range of options. Cross validation options
    are also accessible. A new approach to crossover,            inspired from the
    random assortment of chromosomes during meiosis is included. Several mutation            operators,
    inspired from genetics, are also proposed. The package is fully compatible with
    the data            formats used in Bioconductor and MLInterfaces package, readily
    applicable to microarray studies,            but is flexible to other feature
    selection applications from high dimensional data. Several options for            the
    visualization of evolution and outcomes are implemented to facilitate the interpretation
    of results.            The package’s functionality is illustrated by examples.'

    Allele Imputation and Haplotype Determination from Databases
              Composed of Nuclear Families
  author:

  bibauthor: Nathan Medina-Rodríguez and Ángelo Santana
  abstract: '  Abstract The alleHap package is designed for imputing genetic missing
    data and reconstruct non           recombinant haplotypes from pedigree databases
    in a deterministic way. When genotypes of related            individuals are available
    in a number of linked genetic markers, the program starts by identifying            haplotypes
    compatible with the observed genotypes in those markers without missing values.
    If            haplotypes are identified in parents or offspring, missing alleles
    can be imputed in subjects containing            missing values. Several scenarios
    are analyzed: family completely genotyped, children partially            genotyped
    and parents completely genotyped, children fully genotyped and parents containing            entirely
    or partially missing genotypes, and founders and their offspring both only partially
    genotyped.            The alleHap package also has a function to simulate pedigrees
    including all these scenarios. This            article describes in detail how
    our package works for the desired applications, including illustrated            explanations

  author:

  bibauthor: Patrick Breheny and Woodrow Burchett
  abstract: '  Abstract Regression models allow one to isolate the relationship between
    the outcome and an ex           planatory variable while the other variables are
    held constant. Here, we introduce an R package,            visreg, for the convenient
    visualization of this relationship via short, simple function calls. In addition            to
    estimates of this relationship, the package also provides pointwise confidence
    bands and partial            residuals to allow assessment of variability as well
    as outliers and other deviations from modeling            assumptions. The package
    provides several options for visualizing models with interactions, including            lattice
    plots, contour plots, and both static and interactive perspective plots. The implementation
    of            the package is designed to be fully object-oriented and interface
    seamlessly with R’s rich collection of            model classes, allowing a consistent
    interface for visualizing not only linear models, but generalized            linear
    models, proportional hazards models, generalized additive models, robust regression
    models,            and many more.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We present the R package fourierin (Basulto-Elias, 2017) for
    evaluating functions defined as            Fourier-type integrals over a collection
    of argument values. The integrals are finitely supported with            integrands
    involving continuous functions of one or two variables. As an important application,
    such            Fourier integrals arise in so-called “inversion formulas”, where
    one seeks to evaluate a probability            density at a series of points from
    a given characteristic function (or vice versa) through Fourier            transforms.
    This paper intends to fill a gap in current R software, where tools for repeated
    evaluation            of functions as Fourier integrals are not directly available.
    We implement two approaches for such            computations with numerical integration.
    In particular, if the argument collection for evaluation            corresponds
    to a regular grid, then an algorithm from Inverarity (2002) may be employed based            on
    a fast Fourier transform, which creates significant improvements in the speed
    over a second            approach to numerical Fourier integration (where the
    latter also applies to cases where the points for            evaluation are not
    on a grid). We illustrate the package with the computation of probability densities            and
    characteristic functions through Fourier integrals/transforms, for both univariate
    and bivariate            examples.'

  bibauthor: Melanie Prague and Rui Wang and Victor De Gruttola
  abstract: '  Abstract Semi-parametric approaches based on generalized estimating
    equations (GEE) are widely            used to analyze correlated outcomes in longitudinal
    settings. In this paper, we present a package            CRTgeeDR developed for
    cluster randomized trials with missing data (CRTs). For use of inverse            probability
    weighting to adjust for missing data in cluster randomized trials, we show that
    other            software lead to biased estimation for non-independence working
    correlation structure. CRTgeeDR            solves this problem. We also extend
    the ability of existing packages to allow augmented Doubly Robust            GEE
    estimation (DR). Simulation studies demonstrate the consistency of estimators
    implemented in            CRTgeeDR compared to packages such as geepack and the
    gains associated with the use of the DR            for analyzing a binary outcome
    using a logistic regression. Finally, we illustrate the method on data            from
    a sanitation CRT in developing countries.'

  abstract: '  Abstract queueing is a package that solves and provides the main performance
    measures for both            basic Markovian queueing models and single and multiclass

    to build queueing models using S3 methods. The package solves Markovian models
    of the form            M/M/c/K/M/FCFS, open and closed single class Jackson networks,
    open and closed multiclass            networks and mixed networks. Markovian models
    are used when both the customer inter-arrival time            and the server processing
    time are exponentially distributed. Queueing network solvers are useful for            modelling
    situations in which more than one station must be visited.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This article introduces the R package ctmcd, which provides
    an implementation of methods            for the estimation of the parameters of
    a continuous-time Markov chain given that data are only            available on
    a discrete-time basis. This data consists of partial observations of the state
    of the chain,            which are made without error at discrete times, an issue
    also known as the embedding problem for            Markov chains. The functions
    provided comprise matrix logarithm based approximations as described            in
    Israel et al. (2001), as well as Kreinin and Sidelnikova (2001), an expectation-maximization
    algorithm            and a Gibbs sampling approach, both introduced by Bladt and
    Sørensen (2005). For the expectation           maximization algorithm Wald confidence
    intervals based on the Fisher information estimation method            of Oakes
    (1999) are provided. For the Gibbs sampling approach, equal-tailed credibility
    intervals            can be obtained. In order to visualize the parameter estimates,
    a matrix plot function is provided.            The methods described are illustrated

  abstract: '  Abstract A basic understanding of the distributions of study variables

    summary statistics and exploratory data analysis. Unfortunately, this step tends

  abstract: '  Abstract                 We present the BayesBD package providing Bayesian
    inference for boundaries of noisy images.            The BayesBD package implements
    flexible Gaussian process priors indexed by the circle to recover            the
    boundary in a binary or Gaussian noised image. The boundary recovered by BayesBD
    has the            practical advantages of guaranteed geometric restrictions and
    convenient joint inferences under certain            assumptions, in addition
    to its desirable theoretical property of achieving (nearly) minimax optimal            rate
    in a way that is adaptive to the unknown smoothness. The core sampling tasks for
    our model have            linear complexity, and are implemented in C++ for computational
    efficiency using packages Rcpp and            RcppArmadillo. Users can access
    the full functionality of the package in both the command line and            the
    corresponding shiny application. Additionally, the package includes numerous utility
    functions            to aid users in data preparation and analysis of results.
    We compare BayesBD with selected existing            packages using both simulations
    and real data applications, demonstrating the excellent performance            and
    flexibility of BayesBD even when the observation contains complicated structural
    information            that may violate its assumptions.'

    An extensive toolbox is available in the R-extension            package arules.
    However, mining association rules often results in a vast number of found rules,            leaving
    the analyst with the task to go through a large set of rules to identify interesting
    ones. Sifting            manually through extensive sets of rules is time-consuming

    used to display the main outputs of an analysis, have not benefited from such
    enhancements. In            this context, the adegraphics package, available on
    CRAN since 2015, is a complete reimplementation            of the ade4 graphical
    functionalities but with large improvements. The package uses the S4 object            system
    (each graph is an object) and is based on the graphical framework provided by
    lattice and            grid. We give a brief description of the package and illustrate
    some important functionalities to build            elegant graphs.'

    the Liu regression coefficients utilizing a range of different existing biasing

    A Tidy Data Model for Natural Language Processing using
              cleanNLP
  author: Taylor Arnold
  bibauthor: Taylor Arnold
  abstract: '  Abstract Recent advances in natural language processing have produced
    libraries that extract low           level features from a collection of raw texts.
    These features, known as annotations, are usually stored            internally
    in hierarchical, tree-based data structures. This paper proposes a data model
    to represent            annotations as a collection of normalized relational data
    tables optimized for exploratory data analysis            and predictive modeling.
    The R package cleanNLP, which calls one of two state of the art NLP            libraries
    (CoreNLP or spaCy), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It takes
    raw text            as an input and returns a list of normalized tables. Specific
    annotations provided include tokenization,            part of speech tagging,
    named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, dependency parsing, coreference            resolution,
    and word embeddings. The package currently supports input text in English, German,            French,

  abstract: '  Abstract Recently, Mazucheli (2017) uploaded the package mle.tools
    to CRAN. It can be used for            bias corrections of maximum likelihood
    estimates through the methodology proposed by Cox and            Snell (1968).
    The main function of the package, coxsnell.bc(), computes the bias corrected maximum            likelihood
    estimates. Although in general, the bias corrected estimators may be expected
    to have            better sampling properties than the uncorrected estimators,
    analytical expressions from the formula            proposed by Cox and Snell (1968)
    are either tedious or impossible to obtain. The purpose of this paper            is
    twofolded: to introduce the mle.tools package, especially the coxsnell.bc() function;
    secondly, to            compare, for thirty one continuous distributions, the
    bias estimates from the coxsnell.bc() function            and the bias estimates
    from analytical expressions available in the literature. We also compare, for            five
    distributions, the observed and expected Fisher information. Our numerical experiments
    show            that the functions are efficient to estimate the biases by the
    Cox-Snell formula and for calculating the            observed and expected Fisher
    information.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used to measure molecular
    and colloidal inter           actions as well as mechanical properties of biomaterials.
    In this paper the afmToolkit R package is            introduced. This package
    allows the user to automatically batch process AFM force-distance and            force-time
    curves. afmToolkit capabilities range from importing ASCII files and preprocessing
    the            curves (contact point detection, baseline correction. . . ) for
    finding relevant physical information,            such as Young’s modulus, adhesion
    energies and exponential decay for force relaxation and creep            experiments.
    This package also contains plotting, summary and feature extraction functions.
    The            package also comes with several data sets so the user can test
    the aforementioned features with ease.            The package afmToolkit eases
    the basic processing of large amount of AFM F-d/t curves at once. It            is
    also flexible enough to easily incorporate new functions as they are needed and

  author: Pablo J. Villacorta

  abstract: '  Abstract A new R package is presented for dealing with non-normality
    and variance heterogeneity of            sample data when conducting hypothesis
    tests of main effects and interactions in mixed models. The            proposal
    departs from an existing SAS program which implements Johansen’s general formulation
    of            Welch-James’s statistic with approximate degrees of freedom, which
    makes it suitable for testing any            linear hypothesis concerning cell
    means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when            the data
    pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Improved type I error rate control
    is            obtained using bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical
    value, whereas robustness against            non-normality is achieved through
    trimmed means and Winsorized variances. A wrapper function            eases the
    application of the test in common situations, such as performing omnibus tests
    on all effects            and interactions, pairwise contrasts, and tetrad contrasts
    of two-way interactions. The package is            demonstrated in several problems
    including unbalanced univariate and multivariate designs.'

  abstract: '  Abstract                Treatment switching in a randomised controlled
    trial occurs when participants change from their            randomised treatment
    to the other trial treatment during the study. Failure to account for treatment            switching
    in the analysis (i.e. by performing a standard intention-to-treat analysis) can
    lead to biased            estimates of treatment efficacy. The rank preserving
    structural failure time model (RPSFTM) is a            method used to adjust for
    treatment switching in trials with survival outcomes. The RPSFTM is due to            Robins
    and Tsiatis (1991) and has been developed by White et al. (1997, 1999).                The
    method is randomisation based and uses only the randomised treatment group, observed            event
    times, and treatment history in order to estimate a causal treatment effect. The
    treatment effect,            ψ, is estimated by balancing counter-factual event
    times (that would be observed if no treatment            were received) between
    treatment groups. G-estimation is used to find the value of ψ such that a test            statistic
    Z (ψ) = 0. This is usually the test statistic used in the intention-to-treat analysis,
    for example,            the log rank test statistic.                We present
    an R package, rpsftm, that implements the method.'

  abstract: '  Abstract As the number of cyber-attacks continues to grow on a daily
    basis, so does the delay in threat            detection. For instance, in 2015,
    the Office of Personnel Management discovered that approximately            21.5
    million individual records of Federal employees and contractors had been stolen.
    On average,            the time between an attack and its discovery is more than
    200 days. In the case of the OPM breach,            the attack had been going
    on for almost a year. Currently, cyber analysts inspect numerous potential            incidents
    on a daily basis, but have neither the time nor the resources available to perform
    such a task.            anomalyDetection aims to curtail the time frame in which
    anomalous cyber activities go unnoticed            and to aid in the efficient
    discovery of these anomalous transactions among the millions of daily logged            events
    by i) providing an efficient means for pre-processing and aggregating cyber data
    for analysis            by employing a tabular vector transformation and handling
    multicollinearity concerns; ii) offering            numerous built-in multivariate
    statistical functions such as Mahalanobis distance, factor analysis,            principal
    components analysis to identify anomalous activity, iii) incorporating the pipe
    operator            (%>%) to allow it to work well in the tidyverse workflow.
    Combined, anomalyDetection offers cyber            analysts an efficient and simplified
    approach to break up network events into time-segment blocks            and identify
    periods associated with suspected anomalies for further evaluation.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Requiring no analytical forms, nonparametric discrete patterns
    are flexible in representing            complex relationships among random variables.
    This makes them increasingly useful for data-driven            applications. However,
    there appears to be no software tools for simulating nonparametric discrete            patterns,
    which prevents objective evaluation of statistical methods that discover discrete

    the utility of the simulator by showing            the advantage of the FunChisq
    test over Pearson’s chi-square test in detecting functional patterns. This            simulator,

  abstract: '  Abstract Count data can be analyzed using generalized linear mixed
    models when observations            are correlated in ways that require random
    effects. However, count data are often zero-inflated,            containing more
    zeros than would be expected from the typical error distributions. We present
    a new            package, glmmTMB, and compare it to other R packages that fit
    zero-inflated mixed models. The            glmmTMB package fits many types of
    GLMMs and extensions, including models with continuously            distributed
    responses, but here we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB,            MCMCglmm,
    and brms, and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One            unique
    feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its
    ability to            estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized
    by the mean. Overall, its most            appealing features for new users may
    be the combination of speed, flexibility, and its interface’s            similarity

    The package performs two tasks. First, it calculates the change in            the
    probability of the event occurring given a change in a theoretical variable. Second,
    it calculates the            rolling difference in the future probability of the
    event for two scenarios: one where the event occurred            at a given time
    and one where the event does not occur. The package is consistent with the recent            movement
    to depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret quantities of interest with the requisite
    measures            of uncertainty. It is the first to make it easy for researchers
    to interpret shortand long-term effects of            explanatory variables in
    binary autoregressive models, which can have important implications for the            correct
    interpretation of these models.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Integrating R with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) extends
    R’s statistical capabilities            with numerous geoprocessing and data handling
    tools available in a GIS. QGIS is one of the most            popular open-source
    GIS, and it furthermore integrates other GIS programs such as the System for            Automated
    Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) GIS and the Geographic Resources Analysis Support            System
    (GRASS) GIS within a single software environment. This and its QGIS Python API
    makes            it a perfect candidate for console-based geoprocessing. By establishing
    an interface, the R package            RQGIS makes it possible to use QGIS as
    a geoprocessing workhorse from within R. Compared to            other packages
    building a bridge to GIS (e.g., rgrass7, RSAGA, RPyGeo), RQGIS offers a wider            range
    of geoalgorithms, and is often easier to use due to various convenience functions.
    Finally,            RQGIS supports the seamless integration of Python code using
    reticulate from within R for improved            extendability.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In the presence of competing risks a prediction of the time-dynamic
    absolute risk of an event            can be based on cause-specific Cox regression
    models for the event and the competing risks (Benichou            and Gail, 1990).
    We present computationally fast and memory optimized C++ functions with an R inter           face
    for predicting the covariate specific absolute risks, their confidence intervals,
    and their confidence            bands based on right censored time to event data.
    We provide explicit formulas for our implementation            of the estimator
    of the (stratified) baseline hazard function in the presence of tied event times.
    As            a by-product we obtain fast access to the baseline hazards (compared
    to survival::basehaz()) and            predictions of survival probabilities,
    their confidence intervals and confidence bands. Confidence            intervals
    and confidence bands are based on point-wise asymptotic expansions of the corresponding            statistical
    functionals. The software presented here is implemented in the riskRegression

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper describes an R package LeArEst that can be used
    for estimating object dimensions            from a noisy image. The package is
    based on a simple parametric model for data that are drawn from            uniform
    distribution contaminated by an additive error. Our package is able to estimate
    the length            of the object of interest on a given straight line that
    intersects it, as well as to estimate the object area            when it is elliptically
    shaped. The input data may be a numerical vector or an image in JPEG format.            In
    this paper, background statistical models and methods for the package are summarized,
    and the            algorithms and key functions implemented are described. Also,
    examples that demonstrate its usage            are provided.            Availability:

  abstract: '  Abstract We introduce the R package openEBGM, an implementation of
    the Gamma-Poisson Shrinker            (GPS) model for identifying unexpected counts
    in large contingency tables using an empirical Bayes            approach. The
    Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) and quantile scores are obtained from            the
    GPS model estimates. openEBGM provides for the evaluation of counts using a number
    of            different methods, including the model-based disproportionality
    scores, the relative reporting ratio            (RR), and the proportional reporting
    ratio (PRR). Data squashing for computational efficiency and            stratification
    for confounding variable adjustment are included. Application to adverse event
    detection            is discussed.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The USA National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
    is one of the world’s most            important sources of biological information.
    NCBI databases like PubMed and GenBank contain mil           lions of records
    describing bibliographic, genetic, genomic, and medical data. Here I present rentrez,            a
    package which provides an R interface to 50 NCBI databases. The package is well-documented,            contains
    an extensive suite of unit tests and has an active user base. The programmatic
    interface to the            NCBI provided by rentrez allows researchers to query
    databases and download or import particular            records into R sessions
    for subsequent analysis. The complete nature of the package, its extensive            test-suite
    and the fact the package implements the NCBI’s usage policies all make rentrez
    a powerful            aid to developers of new packages that perform more specific
