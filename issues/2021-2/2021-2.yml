  bibtitle: 'Software Engineering and R Programming: A Call for Research'
  author: Melina Vidoni
  bibauthor: Melina Vidoni
  abstract: '  Abstract Although R programming has been a part of research since its
    origins in the 1990s, few            studies address scientific software development
    from a Software Engineering (SE) perspective. The            past few years have
    seen unparalleled growth in the R community, and it is time to push the boundaries            of
    SE research and R programming forwards. This paper discusses relevant studies
    that close this            gap Additionally, it proposes a set of good practices
    derived from those findings aiming to act as a            call-to-arms for both
    the R and RSE (Research SE) community to explore specific, interdisciplinary            paths
    of research.'

  title: We Need Trustworthy R Packages
  bibtitle: We Need Trustworthy R Packages
  author: William Michael Landau
  bibauthor: William Michael Landau
  abstract: '  Abstract There is a need for rigorous software engineering in R packages,
    and there is a need for             new research to bridge scientific computing
    with more traditional computing. Automated tools,             interdisciplinary
    graduate courses, code reviews, and a welcoming developer community will continue             to
    democratize best practices. Democratized software engineering will improve the
    quality, correctness,             and integrity of scientific software, and by
    extension, the disciplines that rely on it.'

  abstract: '  Abstract During the building of a genome-scale metabolic model, there
    are several dead-end metabo           lites and substrates which cannot be imported,
    produced, nor used by any reaction incorporated in            the network. The
    presence of these dead-end metabolites can block out the net flux of the objective            function
    when it is evaluated through Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and when it is not blocked,
    bias            in the biological conclusions increase. In this aspect, the refinement
    to restore the connectivity of            the network can be carried out manually
    or using computational algorithms. The g2f package was            designed as
    a tool to find the gaps from dead-end metabolites and fill them from the stoichiometric            reactions
    of a reference, filtering candidate reactions using a weighting function. Additionally,
    this            algorithm allows downloading all the sets of gene-associated stoichiometric
    reactions for a specific            organism from the KEGG database. Our package
    is compatible with both 4.0.0 and 3.6.0 R versions.'

    Estimating Social Influence Effects in Networks Using A
              Latent Space Adjusted Approach in R
  author: Ran Xu
  bibauthor: Ran Xu
  abstract: '  Abstract Social influence effects have been extensively studied in
    various empirical network research.            However, many challenges remain
    in estimating social influence effects in networks, as influence            effects
    are often entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process
    and the            common social-environmental factors that individuals are embedded
    in. Methods currently available            either do not solve these problems
    or require stringent assumptions. Recent works by Xu (2018) and            others
    have shown that a latent space adjusted approach based on the latent space model
    has the            potential to disentangle the influence effects from other processes,
    and the simulation evidence has            shown that this approach outperforms
    other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recovering the            true social
    influence effect when there is an unobserved trait co-determining influence and
    selection.            In this paper, I will further illustrate how the latent
    space adjusted approach can account for bias in            the estimation of social
    influence effects and how this approach can be easily implemented in R.'

  bibauthor: Gustavo Soutinho and Marta Sestelo and Luís Meira-Machado
  abstract: '  Abstract Multi-state models are a useful way of describing a process
    in which an individual moves            through a number of finite states in continuous
    time. The illness-death model plays a central role in            the theory and
    practice of these models, describing the dynamics of healthy subjects who may
    move to            an intermediate "diseased" state before entering into a terminal
    absorbing state. In these models, one            important goal is the modeling
    of transition rates which is usually done by studying the relationship            between
    covariates and disease evolution. However, biomedical researchers are also interested
    in            reporting other interpretable results in a simple and summarized
    manner. These include estimates            of predictive probabilities, such as
    the transition probabilities, occupation probabilities, cumulative            incidence
    functions, and the sojourn time distributions. The development of survidm package
    has            been motivated by recent contribution that provides answers to
    all these topics. An illustration of the            software usage is included
    using real data.'

  abstract: '  Abstract In many contexts, missing data and disclosure control are
    ubiquitous and challenging            issues. In particular, at statistical agencies,
    the respondent-level data they collect from surveys and            censuses can
    suffer from high rates of missingness. Furthermore, agencies are obliged to protect            respondents’
    privacy when publishing the collected data for public use. The NPBayesImputeCat
    R            package, introduced in this paper, provides routines to i) create
    multiple imputations for missing data            and ii) create synthetic data
    for statistical disclosure control, for multivariate categorical data, with or            without
    structural zeros. We describe the Dirichlet process mixture of products of the
    multinomial            distributions model used in the package and illustrate
    various uses of the package using data samples            from the American Community
    Survey (ACS). We also compare results of the missing data imputation            to
    the mice R package and those of the synthetic data generation to the synthpop

  abstract: '  Abstract This article introduces the cat.dt package for the creation
    of Computerized Adaptive Tests            (CATs). Unlike existing packages, the
    cat.dt package represents the CAT in a Decision Tree (DT)            structure.
    This allows building the test before its administration, ensuring that the creation
    time of the            test is independent of the number of participants. Moreover,
    to accelerate the construction of the tree,            the package controls its
    growth by joining nodes with similar estimations or distributions of the ability            level
    and uses techniques such as message passing and pre-calculations. The constructed
    tree, as well            as the estimation procedure, can be visualized using
    the graphical tools included in the package. An            experiment designed
    to evaluate its performance shows that the cat.dt package drastically reduces            computational
    time in the creation of CATs without compromising accuracy.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Multidimensional scaling (MDS), hierarchical cluster analysis
    (HCA), and discriminant            analysis (DA) are classical techniques which
    deal with data made of n individuals and p variables.            When the individuals
    are divided into T groups, the R package dad associates with each group a            multivariate
    probability density function and then carries out these techniques on the densities,
    which            are estimated by the data under consideration. These techniques
    are based on distance measures            between densities: chi-square, Hellinger,
    Jeffreys, Jensen-Shannon, and L p for discrete densities,            Hellinger
    , Jeffreys, L2 , and 2-Wasserstein for Gaussian densities, and L2 for numeric
    non-Gaussian            densities estimated by the Gaussian kernel method. Practical
    methods help the user to give meaning            to the outputs in the context
    of MDS and HCA and to look for an optimal prediction in the context of            DA
    based on the one-leave-out misclassification ratio. Some functions for data management
    or basic            statistics calculations on groups are annexed.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The number of packages/software for Gaussian State Space models
    has increased over recent            decades. However, there are very few codes
    available for non-Gaussian State Space (NGSS) models            due to analytical
    intractability that prevents exact calculations. One of the few tractable exceptions
    is            the family of NGSS with exact marginal likelihood, named NGSSEML.
    In this work, we present the            wide range of data formats and distributions
    handled by NGSSEML and a package in the R language            to perform classical
    and Bayesian inference for them. Special functions for filtering, forecasting,
    and            smoothing procedures and the exact calculation of the marginal
    likelihood function are provided. The            methods implemented in the package
    are illustrated for count and volatility time series and some            reliability/survival
    models, showing that the codes are easy to handle. Therefore, the NGSSEML            family
    emerges as a simple and interesting option/alternative for modeling non-Gaussian
    time-varying            structures commonly encountered in time series and reliability/survival
    studies.                Keywords: Bayesian, classical inference, reliability,

  abstract: '  Abstract In case–control studies, the odds ratio is commonly used to
    summarize the association be           tween a binary exposure and a dichotomous
    outcome. However, exposure misclassification frequently            appears in
    case–control studies due to inaccurate data reporting, which can produce bias
    in measures            of association. In this article, we implement a Bayesian
    sensitivity analysis of misclassification to            provide a full posterior
    inference on the corrected odds ratio under both non-differential and differen           tial
    misclassification. We present an R (R Core Team, 2018) package BayesSenMC, which
    provides            user-friendly functions for its implementation. The usage
    is illustrated by a real data analysis on the            association between bipolar
    disorder and rheumatoid arthritis.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Partial association, the dependency between variables after
    adjusting for a set of covariates,            is an important statistical notion
    for scientific research. However, if the variables of interest are            ordered
    categorical data, the development of statistical methods and software for assessing
    their            partial association is limited. Following the framework established
    by Liu et al. (2021), we develop an            R package PAsso for assessing Partial
    Associations between ordinal variables. The package provides            various
    functions that allow users to perform a wide spectrum of assessments, including
    quantification,            visualization, and hypothesis testing. In this paper,
    we discuss the implementation of PAsso in detail            and demonstrate its
    utility through an analysis of the 2016 American National Election Study.'

    A Unifying Framework for Parallel and Distributed Processing
              in R using Futures
  author: Henrik Bengtsson
  bibauthor: Henrik Bengtsson
  abstract: '  Abstract A future is a programming construct designed for concurrent
    and asynchronous evaluation            of code, making it particularly useful
    for parallel processing. The future package implements the            Future API
    for programming with futures in R. This minimal API provides sufficient constructs
    for            implementing parallel versions of well-established, high-level
    map-reduce APIs. The future ecosystem            supports exception handling,
    output and condition relaying, parallel random number generation, and            automatic
    identification of globals lowering the threshold to parallelize code. The Future
    API bridges            parallel frontends with parallel backends, following the
    philosophy that end-users are the ones who            choose the parallel backend
    while the developer focuses on what to parallelize. A variety of backends            exist,
    and third-party contributions meeting the specifications, which ensure that the
    same code works            on all backends, are automatically supported. The future
    framework solves several problems not            addressed by other parallel frameworks

  abstract: '  Abstract Balancing the distributions of the confounders across the
    exposure levels in an observational            study through matching or weighting
    is an accepted method to control for confounding due to these            variables
    when estimating the association between an exposure and outcome and reducing the
    degree            of dependence on certain modeling assumptions. Despite the increasing
    popularity in practice, these            procedures cannot be immediately applied
    to datasets with missing values. Multiple imputation of            the missing
    data is a popular approach to account for missing values while preserving the
    number of            units in the dataset and accounting for the uncertainty in
    the missing values. However, to the best            of our knowledge, there is
    no comprehensive matching and weighting software that can be easily            implemented
    with multiply imputed datasets. In this paper, we review this problem and suggest            a
    framework to map out the matching and weighting of multiply imputed datasets to
    5 actions as            well as the best practices to assess balance in these
    datasets after matching and weighting. We also            illustrate these approaches
    using a companion package for R, MatchThem.'

  abstract: '  Abstract When investigators observe non-random samples from populations,
    sample selectivity            problems may occur. The Heckman selection model
    is widely used to deal with selectivity problems.            Based on the EM algorithm,

  abstract: '  Abstract In ophthalmology, the early detection of keratoconus is still
    a crucial problem. Placido            disk corneal topographers are essential
    in clinical practice, and many indices for diagnosing corneal            irregularities
    exist. The main goal of this work is to present the R package rPACI, providing
    several            functions to handle and analyze corneal data. This package
    implements primary indices of corneal            irregularity (based on geometrical
    properties) and compound indices built from the primary ones,            either
    using a generalized linear model or as a Bayesian classifier using a hybrid Bayesian
    network            and performing approximate inference. rPACI aims to make the
    analysis of corneal data accessible for            practitioners and researchers
    in the field. Moreover, a shiny app was developed to use rPACI in any            web

  abstract: '  Abstract Implementations in R of classical general-purpose algorithms
    for local optimization generally            have two major limitations which cause
    difficulties in applications to complex problems: too loose            convergence
    criteria and too long calculation time. By relying on a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm            (MLA),
    a Newton-like method particularly robust for solving local optimization problems,
    we provide            with marqLevAlg package an efficient and general-purpose
    local optimizer which (i) prevents con           vergence to saddle points by
    using a stringent convergence criterion based on the relative distance            to
    minimum/maximum in addition to the stability of the parameters and of the objective
    function;            and (ii) reduces the computation time in complex settings
    by allowing parallel calculations at each            iteration. We demonstrate
    through a variety of cases from the literature that our implementation reli           ably
    and consistently reaches the optimum (even when other optimizers fail) and also
    largely reduces            computational time in complex settings through the
    example of maximum likelihood estimation of            different sophisticated

  abstract: '  Abstract One of the most common applications of spatial data analysis
    is detecting zones, at a certain            scale, where a point-referenced event
    under study is especially concentrated. The detection of such            zones,
    which are usually referred to as hotspots, is essential in certain fields such
    as criminology,            epidemiology, or traffic safety. Traditionally, hotspot
    detection procedures have been developed over            areal units of analysis.
    Although working at this spatial scale can be suitable enough for many research            or
    practical purposes, detecting hotspots at a more accurate level (for instance,
    at the road segment            level) may be more convenient sometimes. Furthermore,
    it is typical that hotspot detection procedures            are entirely focused
    on the determination of zones where an event is (overall) highly concentrated.
    It            is less common, by far, that such procedures focus on detecting
    zones where a specific type of event is            overrepresented in comparison
    with the other types observed, which have been denoted as differential            risk
    hotspots. The R package DRHotNet provides several functionalities to facilitate
    the detection of            differential risk hotspots within a linear network.
    In this paper, DRHotNet is depicted, and its usage            in the R console
    is shown through a detailed analysis of a crime dataset.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Linear transformation models constitute a general family of
    parametric regression models            for discrete and continuous responses.
    To accommodate correlated responses, the model is extended            by incorporating
    mixed effects. This article presents the R package tramME, which builds on existing            implementations
    of transformation models (mlt and tram packages) as well as Laplace approximation            and
    automatic differentiation (using the TMB package), to calculate estimates and
    perform likelihood            inference in mixed-effects transformation models.
    The resulting framework can be readily applied to a            wide range of regression
    problems with grouped data structures.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Left censoring can occur with relative frequency when analyzing
    recurrent events in epi           demiological studies, especially observational
    ones. Concretely, the inclusion of individuals that            were already at
    risk before the effective initiation in a cohort study may cause the unawareness
    of            prior episodes that have already been experienced, and this will
    easily lead to biased and inefficient            estimates. The miRecSurv package
    is based on the use of models with specific baseline hazard, with            multiple
    imputation of the number of prior episodes when unknown by means of the COMPoisson            distribution,
    a very flexible count distribution that can handle over, sub, and equidispersion,
    with a            stratified model depending on whether the individual had or
    had not previously been at risk, and the            use of a frailty term. The
    usage of the package is illustrated by means of a real data example based on            an
    occupational cohort study and a simulation study.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Convenient and easy-to-use programs are readily available
    in R to simulate data from            and probability calculations for several

    CompModels: A Suite of Computer Model Test Functions for

  author: Tony Pourmohamad
  bibauthor: Tony Pourmohamad
  abstract: '  Abstract The CompModels package for R provides a suite of computer
    model test functions that can be            used for computer model prediction/emulation,
    uncertainty quantification, and calibration. Moreover,            the CompModels
    package is especially well suited for the sequential optimization of computer
    models.            The package is a mix of real-world physics problems, known
    mathematical functions, and black-box            functions that have been converted
    into computer models with the goal of Bayesian (i.e., sequential)            optimization
    in mind. Likewise, the package contains computer models that represent either
    the            constrained or unconstrained optimization case, each with varying
    levels of difficulty. In this paper,            we illustrate the use of the package
    with both real-world examples and black-box functions by solving            constrained
    optimization problems via Bayesian optimization. Ultimately, the package is shown
    to            provide users with a source of computer model test functions that
    are reproducible, shareable, and            that can be used for benchmarking
    of novel optimization methods.'

  author: Sebastian Juhl
  bibauthor: Sebastian Juhl
  abstract: '  Abstract Eigenvector-based Spatial filtering constitutes a highly flexible
    semiparametric approach            to account for spatial autocorrelation in a
    regression framework. It combines judiciously selected            eigenvectors
    from a transformed connectivity matrix to construct a synthetic spatial filter
    and remove            spatial patterns from model residuals. This article introduces
    the spfilteR package that provides            several useful and flexible tools
    to estimate spatially filtered linear and generalized linear models in            R.
    While the package features functions to identify relevant eigenvectors based on
    different selection            criteria in an unsupervised fashion, it also helps
    users to perform supervised spatial filtering and            to select eigenvectors
    based on alternative user-defined criteria. Besides a brief discussion of the            eigenvector-based
    spatial filtering approach, this article presents the main functions of the package            and
    illustrates their usage. Comparison to alternative implementations in other R
    packages highlights            the added value of the spfilteR package.'

  bibauthor: Yuliang Xu and Shuo Shuo Liu and Grace Y. Yi
  abstract: '  Abstract Marginal methods have been widely used for analyzing longitudinal
    ordinal data due to their            simplicity in model assumptions, robustness
    in inference results, and easiness in the implementation.            However,
    they are often inapplicable in the presence of measurement errors in the variables.
    Under the            setup of longitudinal studies with ordinal responses and
    covariates subject to misclassification, Chen            et al. (2014) developed
    marginal methods for misclassification adjustments using the second-order            estimating
    equations and proposed a two-stage estimation approach when the validation subsample            is
    available. Parameter estimation is conducted through the Newton-Raphson algorithm,
    and the            asymptotic distribution of the estimators is established. While
    the methods of Chen et al. (2014) can            successfully correct the misclassification
    effects, its implementation is not accessible to general users            due
    to the lack of a software package. In this paper, we develop an R package, mgee2,
    to implement            the marginal methods proposed by Chen et al. (2014). To
    evaluate the performance and illustrate the            features of the package,
    we conduct numerical studies.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces a new flexible distribution for discrete
    data. Approximate moment            estimators of the parameters of the distribution,
    to be used as starting values for numerical opti           mization procedures,
    are discussed. “Exact” moment estimation, effected via a numerical procedure,            and
    maximum likelihood estimation, are considered. The quality of the results produced
    by these            estimators is assessed via simulation experiments. Several
    examples are given of fitting instances of            the new distribution to
    real and simulated data. It is noted that the new distribution is a member            of
    the exponential family. Expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood
    of the new            distribution are derived. The former facilitates the numerical
    maximization of the likelihood with            optim(); the latter provides means
    of calculating or estimating the covariance matrix of of the parame           ter
    estimates. A discrepancy between estimates of the covariance matrix obtained by
    inverting the            Hessian and those obtained by Monte Carlo methods is
    discussed.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces the new package spNetwork that provides
    functions to perform            Network Kernel Density Estimate analysis (NKDE).
    This method is an extension of the classical Kernel            Density Estimate
    (KDE), a non parametric approach to estimate the intensity of a spatial process.            More
    specifically, it adapts the KDE for cases when the study area is a network, constraining

    fish in rivers, etc.). We present and            discuss in this paper the three
    main versions of NKDE: simple, discontinuous, and continuous that            are
    implemented in spNetwork. We illustrate how to apply the three methods and map
    their results            using a sample from a real dataset representing bike
    accidents in a central neighborhood of Montreal.            We also describe the

  bibauthor: Jean-Paul Fox and Konrad Klotzke and Duco Veen
  abstract: ' Abstract Randomized response (RR) designs are used to collect response
    data about sensitive           behaviors (e.g., criminal behavior, sexual desires).
    The modeling of RR data is more complex since it           requires a description
    of the RR process. For the class of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs),           the
    RR process can be represented by an adjusted link function, which relates the
    expected RR           to the linear predictor for most common RR designs. The
    package GLMMRR includes modified           link functions for four different cumulative
    distributions (i.e., logistic, cumulative normal, Gumbel,           Cauchy) for
    GLMs and GLMMs, where the package lme4 facilitates ML and REML estimation.           The
    mixed modeling framework in GLMMRR can be used to jointly analyze data collected
    under           different designs (e.g., dual questioning, multilevel, mixed mode,
    repeated measurements designs,           multiple-group designs). Model-fit tests,
    tools for residual analyses, and plot functions to give           support to a
    profound RR data analysis are added to the well-known features of the GLM and           GLMM
    software (package lme4). Data of Höglinger and Jann (2018) and Höglinger, Jann,

  abstract: '  Abstract A guided tour helps to visualise high-dimensional data by
    showing low-dimensional projec           tions along a projection pursuit optimisation
    path. Projection pursuit is a generalisation of principal            component
    analysis in the sense that different indexes are used to define the interestingness
    of the            projected data. While much work has been done in developing
    new indexes in the literature, less has            been done on understanding
    the optimisation. Index functions can be noisy, might have multiple            local
    maxima as well as an optimal maximum, and are constrained to generate orthonormal
    projection            frames, which complicates the optimization. In addition,
    projection pursuit is primarily used for            exploratory data analysis,
    and finding the local maxima is also useful. The guided tour is especially            useful
    for exploration because it conducts geodesic interpolation connecting steps in
    the optimisation            and shows how the projected data changes as a maxima
    is approached. This work provides new            visual diagnostics for examining
    a choice of optimisation procedure based on the provision of a new            data
    object which collects information throughout the optimisation. It has helped to
    diagnose and fix            several problems with projection pursuit guided tour.
    This work might be useful more broadly for            diagnosing optimisers and
    comparing their performance. The diagnostics are implemented in the R            package
    ferrn.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Sampling from high-dimensional distributions and volume approximation
    of convex bodies            are fundamental operations that appear in optimization,
    finance, engineering, artificial intelligence,            and machine learning.
    In this paper, we present volesti, an R package that provides efficient, scalable            algorithms
    for volume estimation, uniform, and Gaussian sampling from convex polytopes. volesti            scales
    to hundreds of dimensions, handles efficiently three different types of polyhedra
    and pro           vides non existing sampling routines to R. We demonstrate the
    power of volesti by solving several            challenging problems using the
    R language.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The assumption of elliptical symmetry has an important role
    in many theoretical develop           ments and applications. Hence, it is of
    primary importance to be able to test whether that assumption            actually
    holds true or not. Various tests have been proposed in the literature for this
    problem. To the            best of our knowledge, none of them has been implemented
    in R. This article describes the R package            ellipticalsymmetry which
    implements several well-known tests for elliptical symmetry together with            some
    recent tests. We demonstrate the testing procedures with a real data example.'

  abstract: '  Abstract We describe the vote package in R, which implements the plurality
    (or first-past-the-post),            two-round runoff, score, approval, and Single
    Transferable Vote (STV) electoral systems, as well as            methods for selecting
    the Condorcet winner and loser. We emphasize the STV system, which we have            found
    to work well in practice for multi-winner elections with small electorates, such
    as committee            and council elections, and the selection of multiple job
    candidates. For single-winner elections, STV            is also called Instant
    Runoff Voting (IRV), Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), or the alternative vote (AV)            system.
    The package also implements the STV system with equal preferences, for the first
    time in a            software package, to our knowledge. It also implements a
    new variant of STV, in which a minimum            number of candidates from a
    specified group are required to be elected. We illustrate the package with            several
    real examples.'

    RPESE: Risk and Performance Estimators Standard Errors with

  bibauthor: Anthony-Alexander Christidis and R. Douglas Martin
  abstract: '  Abstract The R package RPESE (Risk and Performance Estimators Standard
    Errors) implements a new            method for computing accurate standard errors
    of risk and performance estimators when returns are            serially dependent.
    The new method makes use of the representation of a risk or performance estimator            as
    a summation of a time series of influence-function (IF) transformed returns, and
    computes estimator            standard errors using a sophisticated method of
    estimating the spectral density at frequency zero of the            time series
    of IF-transformed returns. Two additional packages used by RPESE are introduced,
    namely            RPEIF which computes and provides graphical displays of the
    IF of risk and performance estimators,            and RPEGLMEN which implements
    a regularized Gamma generalized linear model polynomial fit to            the
    periodogram of the time series of the IF-transformed returns. A Monte Carlo study
    shows that the            new method provides more accurate estimates of standard
    errors for risk and performance estimators            compared to well-known alternative
    methods in the presence of serial correlation.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Welch’s two-sample t-test based on least squares (LS) estimators
    is generally used to test the            equality of two normal means when the
    variances are not equal. However, this test loses its power            when the
    underlying distribution is not normal. In this paper, two different tests are
    proposed to test            the equality of two long-tailed symmetric (LTS) means
    under heterogeneous variances. Adaptive            modified maximum likelihood
    (AMML) estimators are used in developing the proposed tests since            they
    are highly efficient under LTS distribution. An R package called RobustBF is given
    to show            the implementation of these tests. Simulated Type I error rates
    and powers of the proposed tests are            also given and compared with Welch’s
    t-test based on LS estimators via an extensive Monte Carlo            simulation
