  bibtitle: Taming PITCHf/x Data with XML2R and pitchRx

  abstract: '  Abstract XML2R is a framework that reduces the effort required to transform
    XML content into tables            in a way that preserves parent to child relationships.
    pitchRx applies XML2R’s grammar for XML            manipulation to Major League
    Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM)’s Gameday data. With pitchRx,            one can
    easily obtain and store Gameday data in a remote database. The Gameday website
    hosts a            wealth of XML data, but perhaps most interesting is PITCHf/x.
    Among other things, PITCHf/x data            can be used to recreate a baseball’s
    flight path from a pitcher’s hand to home plate. With pitchRx, one            can
    easily create animations and interactive 3D scatterplots of the baseball’s flight
    path. PITCHf/x data            is also commonly used to generate a static plot
    of baseball locations at the moment they cross home            plate. These plots,
    sometimes called strike-zone plots, can also refer to a plot of event probabilities            over
    the same region. pitchRx provides an easy and robust way to generate strike-zone
    plots using            the ggplot2 package.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The ability to automatically identify areas of homogeneous
    texture present within a greyscale            image is an important feature of
    image processing algorithms. This article describes the R package            LS2Wstat
    which employs a recent wavelet-based test of stationarity for locally stationary
    random fields            to assess such spatial homogeneity. By embedding this
    test within a quadtree image segmentation            procedure we are also able
    to identify texture regions within an image.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Interval censored outcomes arise when a silent event of interest
    is known to have occurred            within a specific time period determined
    by the times of the last negative and first positive diagnostic            tests.
    There is a rich literature on parametric and non-parametric approaches for the
    analysis of            interval-censored outcomes. A commonly used strategy is
    to use a proportional hazards (PH) model            with the baseline hazard function
    parameterized. The proportional hazards assumption can be relaxed            in
    stratified models by allowing the baseline hazard function to vary across strata
    defined by a subset of            explanatory variables. In this paper, we describe
    and implement a new R package straweib, for fitting            a stratified Weibull
    model appropriate for interval censored outcomes. We illustrate the R package            straweib
    by analyzing data from a longitudinal oral health study on the timing of the emergence
    of            permanent teeth in 4430 children.'

    methods, implemented in C, and provide fast and accurate computation of the            density,
    distribution, and quantile function, as well as a random number generator for
    the Wiener            diffusion model. We used the typical Wiener diffusion model
    with four parameters: boundary            separation, non-decision time, initial
    bias and drift rate parameter. Beyond the distribution functions,            we
    provide extended likelihood-based functions that can be used for parameter estimation
    and model            selection. The package can be obtained via CRAN.'

    and all PostgreSQL-like            databases such as Pivotal Inc.’s Greenplum
    Database (GPDB) (Pivotal Inc., 2013a), HAWQ (Pivotal            Inc., 2013b).
    When running on the products of Pivotal Inc., PivotalR utilizes the full power
    of parallel            computation and distributive storage, and thus gives the
    normal R user access to big data. PivotalR            also provides the R wrapper
    for MADlib. MADlib is an open-source library for scalable in-database            analytics.
    It provides data-parallel implementations of mathematical, statistical and machine-learning            algorithms
    for structured and unstructured data. Thus PivotalR also enables the user to apply
    machine            learning algorithms onto big data.'

  abstract: '  Abstract The Rankcluster package is the first R package proposing both
    modeling and clustering            tools for ranking data, potentially multivariate
    and partial. Ranking data are modeled by the Insertion            Sorting Rank
    (ISR) model, which is a meaningful model parametrized by a central ranking and
    a            dispersion parameter. A conditional independence assumption allows
    multivariate rankings to be            taken into account, and clustering is performed
    by means of mixtures of multivariate ISR models.            The parameters of
    the cluster (central rankings and dispersion parameters) help the practitioners            to
    interpret the clustering. Moreover, the Rankcluster package provides an estimate
    of the missing            ranking positions when rankings are partial. After an
    overview of the mixture of multivariate ISR            models, the Rankcluster
    package is described and its use is illustrated through the analysis of two            real

    based on counting q-grams, edit-based distances, and some lesser known heuristic
    distance            functions. Based on this functionality, the package also offers

  abstract: '  Abstract Streaming data, consisting of indefinitely evolving sequences,
    are becoming ubiquitous in            many branches of science and in various
    applications. Computer scientists have developed streaming            applications
    such as Storm and the S4 distributed stream computing platform1 to deal with data            streams.
    However, in current production packages testing and evaluating streaming algorithms
    is            cumbersome. This paper presents RStorm for the development and evaluation
    of streaming algorithms            analogous to these production packages, but
    implemented fully in R. RStorm allows developers of            streaming algorithms
    to quickly test, iterate, and evaluate various implementations of streaming            algorithms.
    The paper provides both a canonical computer science example, the streaming word
    count,            and examples of several statistical applications of RStorm.'

  abstract: '  Abstract As expression microarrays are typically designed relative
    to a reference genome, any            individual genetic variant that overlaps
    a probe’s genomic position can possibly cause a reduction            in hybridization
    due to the probe no longer being a perfect match to a given sample’s mRNA at            that
    locus. If the samples or groups used in a microarray study differ in terms of
    genetic variants,            the results of the microarray experiment can be negatively
    impacted. The oligoMask package is an            R/SQLite framework which can
    utilize publicly available genetic variants and works in conjunction            with
    the oligo package to read in the expression data and remove microarray probes
    which are likely            to impact a given microarray experiment prior to analysis.
    Tools are provided for creating an SQLite            database containing the probe
    and variant annotations and for performing the commonly used RMA            preprocessing
    procedure for Affymetrix microarrays. The oligoMask package is freely available

  abstract: '  Abstract Many self-report measures of attitudes, beliefs, personality,
    and pathology include items that            can be easily manipulated by respondents.
    For example, an individual may deliberately attempt to            manipulate or
    distort responses to simulate grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms            in
    order to reach specific goals such as, for example, obtaining financial compensation,
    avoiding being            charged with a crime, avoiding military duty, or obtaining
    drugs. This article introduces the package            sgr that can be used to
    perform fake data analysis according to the sample generation by replacement            approach.
    The package includes functions for making simple inferences about discrete/ordinal
    fake            data. The package allows to quantify uncertainty in inferences
    based on possible fake data as well as            to study the implications of
    fake data for empirical results.'
