    Santos et al. (2017) to include models commonly used in reliability, survival contexts.            2018), de Pinho et al.

These exact computations are extremely easy to code, can be performed            called NGSSEML. This family unified several different models previously existing in the literature           , analytical calculation of the marginal likelihood, the predictive, filtering distributions,            even in very simple cases. Gamerman et al. (2013) identified a subset of NGSS that allows for exact            feature shared by all of them is the need to use approximations to perform inferential procedures                In spite of this increasing number of models, packages to handle non-Gaussian SSM, a common            Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), etc.            parameters, like sequential Monte Carlo methods or particle filters, importance sampling, particle            packages mentioned above use intensive computational methods for making inferences for the model            lost, and, hence, approximations are required in order to perform inferential procedures. Thus, all                Nevertheless, even for simple structures in this class of models, the analytical tractability is easily            consolidated package with several updated versions.            2021), SsfPack (Koopman et al., 1999) in the Ox software (Doornik, 1997).

The book by Durbin, Koopman (2012)            proposed by West et al. (1985), attracted a great deal of interest due to its flexibility, allowing the            real data. In the SSM class, a general structure, called Dynamic Generalized Linear Models (DGLM),            for methods or models to handle non-Gaussian, non-linear time series that can be applied to            modeling or multivariate Gaussian state-space models.

    <p>  Abstract The number of packages/software for Gaussian State Space models has increased over recent            decades. However, for non-Gaussian State Space (NGSS) models, there are very few codes available            due to analytical intractability that prevents exact calculations. One of the few tractable exceptions is            the family of NGSS with exact marginal likelihood, named NGSSEML. In this work, we present the            wide range of data formats and distributions handled by NGSSEML and a package in the R language            to perform classical and Bayesian inference for them. Special functions for filtering, forecasting and            smoothing procedures and the exact calculation of the marginal likelihood function are provided. The            methods implemented in the package are illustrated for count and volatility time series and some            reliability/survival models, showing that the codes are easy to handle. Therefore, the NGSSEML            family emerges as a simple and interesting option/alternative for modeling non-Gaussian time-varying            structure commonly encountered in time series and reliability/survival studies.
