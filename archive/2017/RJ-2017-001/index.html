<a href="RJ-2017-001.pdf" target="_blank">OrthoPanels: An R Package for Estimating a Dynamic Panel Model with Fixed Effects Using the Orthogonal Re-parameterization Approach</a><br />

Mark Pickup, Paul Gustafson, Davor Cubranic and Geoffrey Evans


This article describes the R package OrthoPanels, which includes the function opm(). This function implements the orthogonal reparameterization approach recommended by Lancaster (2002) to estimate dynamic panel models with fixed effects (and optionally: wave specific intercepts). This article provides a statistical description of the orthogonal reparameterization approach, a demonstration of the package using real-world data, and simulations comparing the estimator to the known-to-be-biased OLS estimator and the commonly used GMM estimator.
