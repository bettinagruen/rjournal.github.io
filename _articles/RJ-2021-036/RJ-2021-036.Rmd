title: 'DChaos: An R Package for Chaotic Time Series Analysis'
abstract: |
  Chaos theory has been hailed as a revolution of thoughts and attracting ever-increasing
   attention of many scientists from diverse disciplines. Chaotic systems are non-linear deterministic
   dynamic systems which can behave like an erratic and apparently random motion. A relevant field
   inside chaos theory is the detection of chaotic behavior from empirical time-series data. One of the
   main features of chaos is the well-known initial-value sensitivity property. Methods and techniques
   related to testing the hypothesis of chaos try to quantify the initial-value sensitive property estimating
   the so-called Lyapunov exponents. This paper describes the main estimation methods of the Lyapunov
   exponent from time series data. At the same time, we present the DChaos library. R users may
   compute the delayed-coordinate embedding vector from time series data, estimates the best-fitted
   neural net model from the delayed-coordinate embedding vectors, calculates analytically the partial
   derivatives from the chosen neural nets model. They can also obtain the neural net estimator of the
   Lyapunov exponent from the partial derivatives computed previously by two different procedures
   and four ways of subsampling by blocks. To sum up, the DChaos package allows the R users to test
   robustly the hypothesis of chaos in order to know if the data-generating process behind time series
   behaves chaotically or not. The packageâ€™s functionality is illustrated by examples.
