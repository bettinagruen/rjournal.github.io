title: 'OpenLand: Software for Quantitative Analysis and Visualization of Land Use
  and Cover Change'
abstract: There is an increasing availability of spatially explicit, freely available
  land use and cover (LUC) time series worldwide. Because of the enormous amount of
  data this represents, the continuous updates and improvements in spatial and temporal
  resolution and category differentiation, as well as increasingly dynamic and complex
  changes made, manual data extraction and analysis is highly time consuming, and
  making software tools available to automatize LUC data assessment is becom ing imperative.
  This paper presents a software developed in R, which combines LUC raster time series
  data and their transitions, calculates state-of-the-art LUC change indicators, and
  creates spatio temporal visualizations, all in a coherent workflow. The functionality
  of the application developed is demonstrated using an LUC dataset of the Pantanal
  floodplain contribution area in Central Brazil.
