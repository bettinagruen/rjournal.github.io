title: Benchmarking R packages for Calculation of Persistent Homology
abstract: |
  Several persistent homology software libraries have been implemented in R. Specifically,
   the Dionysus, GUDHI, and Ripser libraries have been wrapped by the TDA and TDAstats CRAN
   packages. These software represent powerful analysis tools that are computationally expensive and, to
   our knowledge, have not been formally benchmarked. Here, we analyze runtime and memory growth
   for the 2 R packages and the 3 underlying libraries. We find that datasets with less than 3 dimensions
   can be evaluated with persistent homology fastest by the GUDHI library in the TDA package. For
   higher-dimensional datasets, the Ripser library in the TDAstats package is the fastest. Ripser and
   TDAstats are also the most memory-efficient tools to calculate persistent homology.
