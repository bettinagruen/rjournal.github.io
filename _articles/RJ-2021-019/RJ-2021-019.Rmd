title: 'MoTBFs: An R Package for Learning Hybrid Bayesian Networks Using Mixtures
  of Truncated Basis Functions'
abstract: This paper introduces MoTBFs, an R package for manipulating mixtures of
  truncated basis functions. This class of functions allows the representation of
  joint probability distributions involving discrete and continuous variables simultaneously,
  and includes mixtures of truncated exponentials and mixtures of polynomials as special
  cases. The package implements functions for learning the parameters of univariate,
  multivariate, and conditional distributions, and provides support for parameter
  learning in Bayesian networks with both discrete and continuous variables. Probabilistic
  inference using forward sampling is also implemented. Part of the functionality
  of the MoTBFs package relies on the bnlearn package, which includes functions for
  learning the structure of a Bayesian network from a data set. Leveraging this functionality,
  the MoTBFs package supports learning of MoTBF-based Bayesian networks over hybrid
  domains. We give a brief introduction to the methodological context and algorithms
  implemented in the package. An extensive illustrative example is used to describe
  the package, its functionality, and its usage.
