title: Comparing Multiple Survival Functions with Crossing Hazards in R
abstract: It is frequently of interest in time-to-event analysis to compare multiple
  survival functions nonparametrically. However, when the hazard functions cross,
  tests in existing R packages do not perform well. To address the issue, we introduce
  the package survELtest, which provides tests for comparing multiple survival functions
  with possibly crossing hazards. Due to its powerful likelihood ratio formulation,
  this is the only R package to date that works when the hazard functions cross. We
  illustrate the use of the procedures in survELtest by applying them to data from
  randomized clinical trials and simulated datasets. We show that these methods lead
  to more significant results than those obtained by existing R packages.
