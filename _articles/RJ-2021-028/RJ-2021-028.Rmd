title: 'JMcmprsk: An R Package for Joint Modelling of Longitudinal and Survival Data
  with Competing Risks'
abstract: |
  In this paper, we describe an R package named JMcmprsk, for joint modelling of longitudinal
   and survival data with competing risks. The package in its current version implements two joint
   models of longitudinal and survival data proposed to handle competing risks survival data together
   with continuous and ordinal longitudinal outcomes respectively (Elashoff et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010).
   The corresponding R implementations are further illustrated with real examples. The package also
   provides simulation functions to simulate datasets for joint modelling with continuous or ordinal
   outcomes under the competing risks scenario, which provide useful tools to validate and evaluate
   new joint modelling methods.
