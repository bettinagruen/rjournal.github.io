title: 'clustcurv: An R Package for Determining Groups in Multiple Curves '
abstract: |
  In many situations, it could be interesting to ascertain whether groups of curves can be
   performed, especially when confronted with a considerable number of curves. This paper introduces
   an R package, known as clustcurv, for determining clusters of curves with an automatic selection of
   their number. The package can be used for determining groups in multiple survival curves as well as
   for multiple regression curves. Moreover, it can be used with large numbers of curves. An illustration
   of the use of clustcurv is provided, using both real data examples and artificial data.
   Keywords: multiple curves, number of groups, nonparametric, survival analysis, regression models,
   cluster
