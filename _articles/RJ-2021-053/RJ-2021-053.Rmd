title: Reproducible Summary Tables with the gtsummary Package
abstract: |
  The gtsummary package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready
   summary tables in R. A critical part of the work of statisticians, data scientists, and analysts is
   summarizing data sets and regression models in R and publishing or sharing polished summary tables.
   The gtsummary package was created to streamline these everyday analysis tasks by allowing users
   to easily create reproducible summaries of data sets, regression models, survey data, and survival
   data with a simple interface and very little code. The package follows a tidy framework, making it
   easy to integrate with standard data workflows, and offers many table customization features through
   function arguments, helper functions, and custom themes.
