title: 'Regularized Transformation Models: The tramnet Package'
abstract: |
  The tramnet package implements regularized linear transformation models by combining the
   flexible class of transformation models from tram with constrained convex optimization implemented
   in CVXR. Regularized transformation models unify many existing and novel regularized regression
   models under one theoretical and computational framework. Regularization strategies implemented
   for transformation models in tramnet include the Lasso, ridge regression, and the elastic net and
   follow the parameterization in glmnet. Several functionalities for optimizing the hyperparameters,
   including model-based optimization based on the mlrMBO package, are implemented. A multitude
   of S3 methods is deployed for visualization, handling, and simulation purposes. This work aims at
   illustrating all facets of tramnet in realistic settings and comparing regularized transformation models
   with existing implementations of similar models.
