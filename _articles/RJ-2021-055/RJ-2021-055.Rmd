title: 'distr6: R6 Object-Oriented Probability Distributions Interface in R'
abstract: |
  distr6 is an object-oriented (OO) probability distributions interface leveraging the extensibil
  ity and scalability of R6 and the speed and efficiency of Rcpp. Over 50 probability distributions are
   currently implemented in the package with ‘core’ methods, including density, distribution, and gener
  ating functions, and more ‘exotic’ ones, including hazards and distribution function anti-derivatives.
   In addition to simple distributions, distr6 supports compositions such as truncation, mixtures, and
   product distributions. This paper presents the core functionality of the package and demonstrates
   examples for key use-cases. In addition, this paper provides a critical review of the object-oriented
   programming paradigms in R and describes some novel implementations for design patterns and core
   object-oriented features introduced by the package for supporting distr6 components.
