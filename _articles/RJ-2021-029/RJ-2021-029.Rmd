title: Wide-to-tall Data Reshaping Using Regular Expressions and the nc Package
abstract: |
  Regular expressions are powerful tools for extracting tables from non-tabular text data.
   Capturing regular expressions that describe the information to extract from column names can be
   especially useful when reshaping a data table from wide (few rows with many regularly named
   columns) to tall (fewer columns with more rows). We present the R package nc (short for named
   capture), which provides functions for wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions. We
   describe the main new ideas of nc, and provide detailed comparisons with related R packages (stats,
   utils, data.table, tidyr, tidyfast, tidyfst, reshape2, cdata).
