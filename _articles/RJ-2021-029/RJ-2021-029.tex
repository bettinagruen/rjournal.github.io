\title{Wide-to-tall Data Reshaping Using Regular Expressions and the nc
Package}
\author{by Toby Dylan Hocking}

\maketitle

\abstract{%
Regular expressions are powerful tools for extracting tables from
non-tabular text data. Capturing regular expressions that describe the
information to extract from column names can be especially useful when
reshaping a data table from wide (few rows with many regularly named
columns) to tall (fewer columns with more rows). We present the R
package nc (short for named capture), which provides functions for
wide-to-tall data reshaping using regular expressions. We describe the
main new ideas of nc, and provide detailed comparisons with related R
packages (stats, utils, data.table, tidyr, tidyfast, tidyfst, reshape2,
cdata).
