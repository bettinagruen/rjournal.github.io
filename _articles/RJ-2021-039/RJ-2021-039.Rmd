title: 'StratigrapheR: Concepts for Litholog Generation in R '
abstract: 'The StratigrapheR package proposes new concepts for the generation of lithological
  logs, or lithologs, in R. The generation of lithologs in a scripting environment
  opens new opportunities for the processing and analysis of stratified geological
  data. Among the new concepts presented: new plotting and data processing methodologies,
  new general R functions, and computer-oriented data conventions are provided. The
  package structure allows for these new concepts to be further improved, which can
  be done independently by any R user. The current limitations of the package are
  highlighted, along with the limitations in R for geological data processing, to
  help identify the best paths for improvements.'
