title: Analyzing Basket Trials under Multisource Exchangeability Assumptions
abstract: 'Basket designs are prospective clinical trials that are devised with the
  hypothesis that the presence of selected molecular features determine a patient’s
  subsequent response to a particular “targeted” treatment strategy. Basket trials
  are designed to enroll multiple clinical subpopulations to which it is assumed that
  the therapy in question offers beneficial efficacy in the presence of the targeted
  molecular profile. The treatment, however, may not offer acceptable efficacy to
  all subpopulations enrolled. Moreover, for rare disease settings, such as oncology
  wherein these trials have become popular, marginal measures of statistical evidence
  are difficult to interpret for sparsely enrolled subpopulations. Consequently, basket
  trials pose challenges to the traditional paradigm for trial design, which assumes
  inter-patient exchangeability. The package basket for the R programmming environment
  (R Core Team, 2019) facilitates the analysis of basket trials by implementing multi
  source exchangeability models. By evaluating all possible pairwise exchangeability
  relationships, this hierarchical modeling framework facilitates Bayesian posterior
  shrinkage among a collection of discrete and pre-specified subpopulations. Analysis
  functions are provided to implement posterior inference of the response rates and
  all possible exchangeability relationships between subpopulations. In addition,
  the package can identify “poolable” subsets of and report their response characteristics.
  The functionality of the package is demonstrated using data from an oncology study
  with subpopulations defined by tumor histology. Keywords: Bayesian analysis, basket
  design, hierarchical model, master protocol, oncology, patient heterogeneity'
