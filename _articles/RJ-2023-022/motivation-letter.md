Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "A Clustering Algorithm to Organize Satellite Hotspot Data for the Purpose of Tracking Bushfires Remotely" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `spotoroo` which provides the implementation of a new algorithm for spatiotemporal clustering, useful for identifying ignition points of bushfires from satellite hot spot data. The work is motivated by wanting to better understand the catastrophic fires in Australia in the 2019-2020 summer. 

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides generally useful instructions that will work for many purposes.
