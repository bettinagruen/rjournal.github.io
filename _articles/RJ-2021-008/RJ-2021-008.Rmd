title: Testing the equality of normal distributed and independent groups' means under
  unequal variances by doex package
abstract: In this paper, we present the doex package contains the tests for equality
  of normal dis tributed and independent group means under unequal variances such
  as Cochran F, Welch-Aspin, Welch, Box, Scott-Smith, Brown-Forsythe, Johansen F,
  Approximate F, Alexander-Govern, Generalized F, Modified Brown-Forsythe, Permutation
  F, Adjusted Welch, B2, Parametric Bootstrap, Fiducial Approach, and Alvandi Generalized
  F-test. Most of these tests are not available in any package. Thus, doex is easy
  to use for researchers in multidisciplinary studies. In this study, an extensive
  Monte-Carlo simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the
  the tests for equality of normal distributed group means under unequal variances
  in terms of Type I error probability and penalized power. In the case of Type I
  error probability of the compared tests are different, the penalized power is used
  which allows fair power comparisons. In this way, we conclude the performance of
  the tests by taking into account two possible errors in hypothesis testing.
