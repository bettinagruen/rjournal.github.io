title: 'TULIP: A Toolbox for Linear Discriminant Analysis with Penalties'
abstract: Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a powerful tool in building classifiers
  with easy computation and interpretation. Recent advancements in science technology
  have led to the popularity of datasets with high dimensions, high orders and complicated
  structure. Such datasetes motivate the generalization of LDA in various research
  directions. The R package TULIP integrates several popular high-dimensional LDA-based
  methods and provides a comprehensive and user-friendly toolbox for linear, semi-parametric
  and tensor-variate classification. Functions are included for model fitting, cross
  validation and prediction. In addition, motivated by datasets with diverse sources
  of predictors, we further include functions for covariate adjustment. Our package
  is carefully tailored for low storage and high computation efficiency. Moreover,
  our package is the first R package for many of these methods, providing great convenience
  to researchers in this area.
