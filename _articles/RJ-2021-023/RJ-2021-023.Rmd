title: 'FarmTest: An R Package for Factor-Adjusted Robust Multiple Testing'
abstract: 'We provide a publicly available library FarmTest in the R programming system.
  This library implements a factor-adjusted robust multiple testing principle proposed
  by Fan et al. (2019) for large-scale simultaneous inference on mean effects. We
  use a multi-factor model to explicitly capture the dependence among a large pool
  of variables. Three types of factors are considered: observable, latent, and a mixture
  of observable and latent factors. The non-factor case, which corresponds to standard
  multiple mean testing under weak dependence, is also included. The library implements
  a series of adaptive Huber methods integrated with fast data-driven tuning schemes
  to estimate model parameters and to construct test statistics that are robust against
  heavy-tailed and asymmetric error distributions. Extensions to two-sample multiple
  mean testing problems are also discussed. The results of some simulation experiments
  and a real data analysis are reported.'
