title: A Fast and Scalable Implementation Method for Competing Risks Data with the
  R Package fastcmprsk
abstract: Advancements in medical informatics tools and high-throughput biological
  experimentation make large-scale biomedical data routinely accessible to researchers.
  Competing risks data are typical in biomedical studies where individuals are at
  risk to more than one cause (type of event) which can preclude the others from happening.
  The Fine and Gray (1999) proportional subdistribution hazards model is a popular
  and well-appreciated model for competing risks data and is currently implemented
  in a number of statistical software packages. However, current implementations are
  not computation ally scalable for large-scale competing risks data. We have developed
  an R package, fastcmprsk, that uses a novel forward-backward scan algorithm to significantly
  reduce the computational complexity for parameter estimation by exploiting the structure
  of the subject-specific risk sets. Numerical studies compare the speed and scalability
  of our implementation to current methods for unpenalized and penalized Fine-Gray
  regression and show impressive gains in computational efficiency.
