title: Visual Diagnostics for Constrained Optimisation with Application to Guided
  Tours
abstract: A guided tour helps to visualise high-dimensional data by showing low-dimensional
  projec tions along a projection pursuit optimisation path. Projection pursuit is
  a generalisation of principal component analysis in the sense that different indexes
  are used to define the interestingness of the projected data. While much work has
  been done in developing new indexes in the literature, less has been done on understanding
  the optimisation. Index functions can be noisy, might have multiple local maxima
  as well as an optimal maximum, and are constrained to generate orthonormal projection
  frames, which complicates the optimization. In addition, projection pursuit is primarily
  used for exploratory data analysis, and finding the local maxima is also useful.
  The guided tour is especially useful for exploration because it conducts geodesic
  interpolation connecting steps in the optimisation and shows how the projected data
  changes as a maxima is approached. This work provides new visual diagnostics for
  examining a choice of optimisation procedure based on the provision of a new data
  object which collects information throughout the optimisation. It has helped to
  diagnose and fix several problems with projection pursuit guided tour. This work
  might be useful more broadly for diagnosing optimisers and comparing their performance.
  The diagnostics are implemented in the R package ferrn.
