title: Statistical Quality Control with the qcr Package
abstract: |
  The R package qcr for Statistical Quality Control (SQC) is introduced and described. It
       includes a comprehensive set of univariate and multivariate SQC tools that completes and increases
       the SQC techniques available in R. Apart from integrating different R packages devoted to SQC (qcc,
       MSQC), qcr provides nonparametric tools that are highly useful when Gaussian assumption is not
       met. This package computes standard univariate control charts for individual measurements, x̄, S, R,
       p, np, c, u, EWMA, and CUSUM. In addition, it includes functions to perform multivariate control
       charts such as Hotelling T2 , MEWMA and MCUSUM. As representative features, multivariate
       nonparametric alternatives based on data depth are implemented in this package: r, Q and S control
       charts. The qcr library also estimates the most complete set of capability indices from first to
       the fourth generation, covering the nonparametric alternatives, and performing the corresponding
       capability analysis graphical outputs, including the process capability plots. Moreover, Phase I and
       II control charts for functional data are included.
