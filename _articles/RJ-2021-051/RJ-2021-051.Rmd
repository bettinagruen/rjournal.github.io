title: Automating Reproducible, Collaborative Clinical Trial Document Generation with
  the listdown Package
abstract: |
  The conveyance of clinical trial explorations and analysis results from a statistician to a clinical
   investigator is a critical component of the drug development and clinical research cycle. Automating
   the process of generating documents for data descriptions, summaries, exploration, and analysis
   allows the statistician to provide a more comprehensive view of the information captured by a clinical
   trial, and efficient generation of these documents allows the statistican to focus more on the conceptual
   development of a trial or trial analysis and less on the implementation of the summaries and results
   on which decisions are made. This paper explores the use of the listdown package for automating
   reproducible documents in clinical trials that facilitate the collaboration between statisticians and
   clinicians as well as defining an analysis pipeline for document generation.
