title: 'ROBustness In Network (robin): an R Package for Comparison and Validation
  of Communities '
abstract: |
  In network analysis, many community detection algorithms have been developed. However,
   their implementation leaves unaddressed the question of the statistical validation of the results. Here,
   we present robin (ROBustness In Network), an R package to assess the robustness of the community
   structure of a network found by one or more methods to give indications about their reliability. The
   procedure initially detects if the community structure found by a set of algorithms is statistically
   significant and then compares two selected detection algorithms on the same graph to choose the
   one that better fits the network of interest. We demonstrate the use of our package on the American
   College Football benchmark dataset.
