title: 'pdynmc: A Package for Estimating Linear Dynamic Panel Data Models Based on
  Nonlinear Moment Conditions'
abstract: |
  This paper introduces pdynmc, an R package that provides users sufficient flexibility
   and precise control over the estimation and inference in linear dynamic panel data models. The
   package primarily allows for the inclusion of nonlinear moment conditions and the use of iterated
   GMM; additionally, visualizations for data structure and estimation results are provided. The current
   implementation reflects recent developments in literature, uses sensible argument defaults, and
   aligns commercial and noncommercial estimation commands. Since the understanding of the model
   assumptions is vital for setting up plausible estimation routines, we provide a broad introduction
   of linear dynamic panel data models directed towards practitioners before concisely describing the
   functionality available in pdynmc regarding instrument type, covariate type, estimation methodology,
   and general configuration. We then demonstrate the functionality by revisiting the popular firm-level
   dataset of Arellano and Bond (1991).
