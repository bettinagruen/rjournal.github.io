title: 'npcure: An R Package for Nonparametric Inference in Mixture Cure Models'
abstract: |
  Mixture cure models have been widely used to analyze survival data with a cure fraction.
   They assume that a subgroup of the individuals under study will never experience the event (cured
   subjects). So, the goal is twofold: to study both the cure probability and the failure time of the
   uncured individuals through a proper survival function (latency). The R package npcure implements a
   completely nonparametric approach for estimating these functions in mixture cure models, considering
   right-censored survival times. Nonparametric estimators for the cure probability and the latency as
   functions of a covariate are provided. Bootstrap bandwidth selectors for the estimators are included.
   The package also implements a nonparametric covariate significance test for the cure probability,
   which can be applied with a continuous, discrete, or qualitative covariate.
