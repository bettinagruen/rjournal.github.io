title: 'IndexNumber: An R Package for Measuring the Evolution of Magnitudes'
abstract: |
  Index numbers are descriptive statistical measures useful in economic settings for comparing
   simple and complex magnitudes registered, usually in two time periods. Although this theory has
   a large history, it still plays an important role in modern todayâ€™s societies where big amounts of
   economic data are available and need to be analyzed. After a detailed revision on classical index
   numbers in literature, this paper is focused on the description of the R package IndexNumber with
   strong capabilities for calculating them. Two of the four real data sets contained in this library
   are used for illustrating the determination of the index numbers in this work. Graphical tools are
   also implemented in order to show the time evolution of considered magnitudes simplifying the
   interpretation of the results.
