title: 'garchx: Flexible and Robust GARCH-X Modeling'
abstract: |
  The garchx package provides a user-friendly, fast, flexible, and robust framework for the
   estimation and inference of GARCH(p, q, r)-X models, where p is the ARCH order, q is the GARCH
   order, r is the asymmetry or leverage order, and ’X’ indicates that covariates can be included. Quasi
   Maximum Likelihood (QML) methods ensure estimates are consistent and standard errors valid,
   even when the standardized innovations are non-normal or dependent, or both. Zero-coefficient
   restrictions by omission enable parsimonious specifications, and functions to facilitate the non-standard
   inference associated with zero-restrictions in the null-hypothesis are provided. Finally, in the formal
   comparisons of precision and speed, the garchx package performs well relative to other prominent
   GARCH-packages on CRAN.
