\abstract{%
Molecular simulations solve the equation of motion of molecular systems,
making the 3D shapes of molecules four-dimensional by adding the time
coordinate. These methods have great potential in drug discovery because
they can realistically model the structures of protein molecules
targeted by drugs, as well as the process of binding of a potential drug
to its molecular target. However, routine application of biomolecular
simulations is hampered by the very high computational costs of this
method. Several methods have been developed to address this problem. One
of them, metadynamics, disfavors states of the simulated system that
have been already visited and thus forces the system to explore new
states. Here we present the package \CRANpkg{metadynminer} and
\CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} to analyze and visualize results from
metadynamics, in particular those produced by a popular metadynamics
package Plumed.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Molecular simulations and their pioneers Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt,
and Arieh Warshel have been awarded the Nobel Prize in 2013
\citep{nobel}. Their methods, in particular the method of molecular
dynamics simulation, computationally simulate the motions of atoms in a
molecular system. A simulation starts from a molecular system defined by
positions (Cartesian coordinates) of the individual atoms. The heart of
the method is in a calculation of forces acting on individual atoms and
their numerical integration in the spirit of Newtonian dynamics, i.e.,
the conversion of a force vector to an acceleration vector, then
velocity vector and, finally, to a new position of an atom. By repeating
these steps, it is possible to reconstruct a record of atomic motions
known as a trajectory.

Molecular simulations have great potential in drug discovery. A molecule
of drug influences (enhances or blocks) the function of some biomolecule
in the patient's body, typically a receptor, enzyme or other protein.
These molecules are called drug targets. The process of design for a new
drug can be significantly accelerated with knowledge of the 3D structure
(Cartesian coordinates of atoms) of the target. With such knowledge, it
is possible to find a ``druggable'' cavity in the target and a molecule
that fits and favorably binds to this cavity to influence its function.
Strong binding implies that the drug influences the target even in low
doses, hence does not cause side effects by interacting with unwanted
targets.

Experimental determination of the 3D structures of proteins and other
biomolecules is a very expensive and laborious process. Molecular
simulations can, at least in principle, replace such expensive and
laborious experiments by computing. In principle, a molecular simulation
starting from virtually any 3D shape of a molecule would end up in
energetically the most favorable shape. This is analogous with water
flowing from mountains to valleys and not in the opposite way.

Unfortunately, this approach is extremely computationally expensive. The
integration step of a simulation must be small enough to comprise the
fastest motions in the molecular system. In practical simulations, it is
necessary to use femtosecond integration steps. This means that it is
necessary to carry out thousands of steps to simulate picoseconds,
millions of steps to simulate nanoseconds, and so forth. In each step,
it is necessary to evaluate a substantial number of interactions between
atoms. As a result, it is possible to routinely simulate nano- to
microseconds. Longer simulations require special high-performance
computing resources.

Protein folding, i.e., the transition from a quasi-random to the
biologically relevant 3D structure, takes place in microseconds for very
small proteins and in much longer time scales for pharmaceutically
interesting proteins. For this reason, prediction of a 3D structure by
molecular simulations is limited to few small and fast folding proteins.
For large proteins, it is currently impossible or at least far from
being routine.

Several methods have been developed to address this problem.
Metadynamics \citep{mtd} uses artificial forces to force the system to
explore states that have not been previously explored in the simulation.
At the beginning of the simulation, it is necessary to chose some
parameters of the system referred to as collective variables. For
example, numerically expressed compactness of the protein can be used as
a collective variable to accelerate its folding from a noncompact to a
compact 3D structure. Metadynamics starts as a usual simulation. After a
certain number of steps (typically 500), the values of the collective
variables are calculated and from this moment this state becomes
slightly energetically disfavored due to the addition of an artificial
bias potential in the shape of a Gaussian hill. After another 500 steps,
another hill is added to the bias potential and so forth. These Gaussian
hills accumulate until they ``flood'' some energy minimum and help the
system to escape this minimum and explore various other states (Figure
\ref{fig:Metadynamics}). In the analogy of water floating from mountains
to valleys, metadynamics adds ``sand'' to fill valleys to make water
flow from valleys back to mountains. This makes the simulation
significantly more efficient compared to a conventional simulation
because the ``water'' does not get stuck anywhere.

Using the application of metadynamics, it is possible to significantly
accelerate the process of folding. Hopefully, by the end of metadynamics
we can see folded, unfolded, and many other states of the protein.
However, the interpretation of the trajectory is not straightforward. In
standard molecular dynamics simulation (without metadynamics), the state
which is the most populated is the most populated in reality. This is
not true anymore with metadynamics.

Packages \CRANpkg{metadynminer} and \CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} use the
results of metadynamics simulations to calculate the free energy surface
of the molecular system. The most favored states (states most populated
in reality) correspond to minima on the free energy surface. The state
with the lowest free energy is the most populated state in the reality,
i.e., the folded 3D structure of the protein.

As an example to illustrate metadynamics and our package, we use an
ultrasimple molecule of ``alanine dipeptide'' (Figure
\ref{fig:Metadynamics}). This molecule can be viewed as a ``protein''
with just one amino acid residue (real proteins have hundreds or
thousands of amino acid residues). As a collective variable it is
possible to use an angle \(\phi\) defined by four atoms. Biasing of this
collective variable accelerates a slow rotation around the corresponding
bond. Figure \ref{fig:Metadynamics} shows the free energy surface of
alanine dipeptide as the black thick line. It is not known before the
simulation. The simulation starts from the state B. After 500 simulation
steps, the hill is added (the hill is depicted as the red line, the
flooding potential (``sand'') at the top, the free energy surface with
added flooding potential at the bottom). The sum of 1, 10, 100, 200,
500, and 700 hills are depicted as red to blue lines.

At the end of simulation the free energy surface is relatively well
flattened (blue line in Fig. \ref{fig:Metadynamics} bottom). Therefore,
the free energy surface can be estimated as a negative imprint of added
``sand'':

\begin{equation}
G(s) = -kT \log(P(s)) = -V(s) = \sum_i w_i \exp(-(s-S_i)^2/{2 \sigma^2}),
\label{eq:mtd}
\end{equation}

where \(G\), \(V\), and \(P\) are free energy, metadynamics bias
(flooding) potential, and probability, respectively, of a state with a
collective variable \(s\), \(k\) is Boltzmann constant, \(T\) is
temperature in Kelvins, \(w_i\) is height, \(S_i\) is position and
\(\sigma_i\) is width of each hill. The equation can be easily
generalized for two or more collective variables.

\caption[Metadynamics simulation of alanine dipeptide]{Metadynamics simulation of alanine dipeptide. Dihedral angle $\phi$ was used as the collective variable. The top part shows molecular structures of three free energy minima (stable structures) differing in the value of $\phi$. According to metadynamics prediction, A is the global minimum (free energy 0 kJ/mol) and B and C are local minima (1.5 and 6.3 kJ/mol, respectively). According to Equation 1, this corresponds to probabilities 0.61, 0.34, and 0.05 for A, B, and C, respectively. The middle part shows the bias potential (scaled by $(T+\Delta T)/\Delta T$) after addition of 1, 10, 100, 200, 500, and 700 hills (colors from red to blue). The bottom part shows the accurate free energy surface calculated by metadynamics with 30,000 hills (black) flooded by 1, 10, 100, 200, 500, and 700 hills (colors from red to blue).

\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

The original version of metadynamics was developed with constant heights
of Gaussian hills. Later, a so-called well-tempered metadynamics was
developed \citep{wtmtd}, which uses decreasing hill heights to improve
the accuracy of the results. This requires modification of the equation:

\begin{equation}
G(s) = -kT \log(P(s)) = - \frac{T + \Delta T}{\Delta T} V(s) =
- \frac{T + \Delta T}{\Delta T} \sum_i w_i \exp(-(s-S_i)^2/{2 \sigma^2}),
\label{eq:wtmtd}
\end{equation}

where \(\Delta T\) an input parameter with the dimension of temperature
(zero for unbiased simulation and infinity for the original metadynamics
with constant hill heights). Nowadays, the vast majority of metadynamics
applications use the well-tempered metadynamics algorithm for better
convergence towards an accurate free energy surface prediction.

There are numerous packages for molecular simulations such as Amber
\citep{amber}, Gromacs \citep{gmx}, Gromos \citep{gms}, NAMD
\citep{namd}, CHARMM \citep{charmm}, Acemd \citep{acemd}, and others.
These packages are primarily developed for basic unbiased simulations
with no or very limited support of metadynamics. Plumed software
\citep{plumed} has been developed to introduce metadynamics into various
simulation programs. Since its introduction, Plumed articles have been
cited in more than thousand papers from drug design, molecular biology,
material sciences, and other fields. The R package
\CRANpkg{metadynminer} was developed for analysis and visualization of
the results from Plumed. With a simple file conversion script, it can be
used also with other simulation programs that support metadynamics.

\hypertarget{example-of-usage}{%
\section{Example of usage}\label{example-of-usage}}

The package \CRANpkg{metadynminer} will be presented on a bias potential
from a 30 ns (30,000 hills) simulation of alanine dipeptide (Figure
\ref{fig:Metadynamics}). Two rotatable bonds of the molecule, referred
to as \(\phi\) and \(\psi\), were used as collective variables. This is
basically an expansion of the free energy surface in Figure
\ref{fig:Metadynamics} to two dimensions. Hills from simulations with
two collective variables (\(\phi\) and \(\psi\)) and with one collective
variable (\(\phi\)) are provided in \CRANpkg{metadynminer} as
\texttt{acealanme} and \texttt{acealanme1d}, respectively.
\CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} was developed for analysis of metadynamics with
three collective variables. It contains a sample data
\texttt{acealanmed3}, with collective variables \(\phi\), \(\psi\) and
\(\omega\). We decided to distribute \CRANpkg{metadynminer} and
\CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} separately, because of the use of different
visualization tools and to keep the size of packages low. Metadynamics
simulations with 1-3 collective variables comprise almost all
metadynamics applications nowadays (not considering special metadynamics
variants).

Hills file generated by Plumed package (filename HILLS) can be loaded to
R by the function \texttt{read.hills}:

\begin{verbatim}
  hillsfile <- read.hills("HILLS", per=c(TRUE, TRUE))
\end{verbatim}

The parameter \texttt{per} indicates periodicity of the collective
variable (dihedral angles are periodic, i.e., \(+\pi \simeq -\pi\)). For
the simulation described above, \texttt{hillsfile} is identical to
\texttt{acealanme} already contained in \CRANpkg{metadynminer} as an
example.

Typing the name \texttt{hillsfile} will return its dimensionality (the
number of collective variables) and the number of hills. A hills object
can be plotted:

\begin{verbatim}
  plot(hillsfile, xlab="phi", ylab="psi", pch=19, cex=0.5, col=gray(0, 0.1))
\end{verbatim}

For metadynamics with one collective variable, it plots its evolution.
For metadynamics with two or three collective variables, it plots a
scatter plot of collective variables number 1 vs.~2 or 1 vs.~2 vs.~3,
respectively (Figure \ref{fig:plothills}).

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{metadynminer_files/figure-latex/plothills-1} 

}

\caption[Scatter plot of hills position]{Scatter plot of hills position. Each point in the plot represents a single hill in the space of collective variable coordinates. This helps to assess which states of the system were sampled.}\label{fig:plothills}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

In well-tempered metadynamics it may be interesting to see the evolution
of hill heights (\(w_i\) in Equation \eqref{eq:wtmtd}). This can be
plotted (Figure \ref{fig:plotheights}) by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
  plotheights(hillsfile)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{metadynminer_files/figure-latex/plotheights-1} 

}

\caption[Evolution of heights of hills in metadynamics plotted by function plotheights]{Evolution of heights of hills in metadynamics plotted by function plotheights. In well-tempered metadynamics, heights of hills decrease with the progress of flooding of free energy minima. The evolution of heights of hills may help to assess the completeness of flooding.}\label{fig:plotheights}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

Addition operation is available for hillsfile object. For example,
multiple hills files can be concatenated.

Next, the user can sum negative values of all hills to make the free
energy surface estimate by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
  fesurface <- fes(hillsfile)
\end{verbatim}

Hills files from well-tempered metadynamics are prescaled by
\((\Delta T + T)/\Delta T\) when printed by Plumed, so no special action
is required in \CRANpkg{metadynminer}. The function \texttt{fes} uses
the Bias Sum algorithm \citep{petr}. This function is fast because
instead of evaluation of Gaussian function for every hill, it uses a
precomputed Gaussian hill that is relocated to hill centers. It is also
fast because it was implemented in C++ via \CRANpkg{Rcpp}. Because of
approximations used in the function \texttt{fes}, this function should
be used for visualization purposes. For detailed analysis of a free
energy surface, we advise to use a slow but accurate \texttt{fes2}
function. This function explicitly evaluates Gaussian function for every
hill. It can be also used for (rarely used) metadynamics with variable
hill widths.

Typing the name of the variable with a free energy surface returns its
dimensionality, number of points, and free energy maximum and minimum.
The same is returned by \texttt{summary} function. It is possible to add
and subtract two free energy surfaces with the same number of grid
points. The functions \texttt{min} and \texttt{max} can be used as well
to calculate minimum or maximum. It is also possible to multiply or
divide the free energy surface by a constant (for example, to convert kJ
to kcal and vice versa). Free energy surface can be plotted (Figure
\ref{fig:plotfes}) by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
  plot(fesurface, xlab="phi", ylab="psi")
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{metadynminer_files/figure-latex/plotfes-1} 

}

\caption[Free energy surface]{Free energy surface. Minima (blue colors) represent stable states with high abundance, whereas regions with high free energy correspond to low abundance states.}\label{fig:plotfes}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

In metadynamics simulation, it is important to find free energy minima.
The global minimum refers to the most favored state of the system (i.e.,
the state with the highest probability). Other local minima correspond
to metastable states. The user can find free energy minima by typing:

\begin{verbatim}
  minima <- fesminima(fesurface)
\end{verbatim}

This function locates minima using a simple algorithm. The free energy
surface is separated into 8, 8x8, or 8x8x8 bins (for 1D, 2D, or 3D
surface, respectively). The minimum in each bin is located. Next, the
program tests whether the minimum is a local minimum of the whole free
energy surface. The number of grid points can be changed by
\texttt{ngrid} parameter. Typing the name of the minima variable will
return the table of minima (denoted as A, B, C, \ldots{} in the order of
their free energies), their collective variables, and free energy
values.

In addition, the function summary provides populations of each minimum
calculated as: \begin{equation}
P_{i,rel} = \exp(-G_i/kT),
\end{equation} \begin{equation}
P_i = P_{i,rel} / \sum (P_{j,rel}).
\end{equation}

Using the plot function on a \texttt{fesminima} output provides the same
plot as for \texttt{fes} output with additional letters indicating
minima (Figure \ref{fig:minima}).

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{metadynminer_files/figure-latex/minima-1} 

}

\caption[Free energy surface with indicated free energy minima A-E]{Free energy surface with indicated free energy minima A-E. The minimum A is the most abundant state, minima B-E are metastable states.}\label{fig:minima}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

It is essential to evaluate the accuracy of metadynamics and to decide
when the simulation is accurate enough so that it can be stopped. For
this purpose, it is useful to look at the evolution of relative free
energies. The relative free energies (for example, the free energy
difference of minima A and C) evolve rapidly at the beginning of the
simulation, and with the progress of the simulation, their difference is
converging towards the real free energy difference. Function
\texttt{feprof} calculates the evolution of free energy differences from
the global minimum (global at the end of the simulation). It can be used
as:

\begin{verbatim}
  prof <- feprof(minima)
\end{verbatim}

Function summary provides minima and maxima of these free energy
differences. The evolution can be plotted (Figure \ref{fig:conv}) by
typing:

\begin{verbatim}
  plot(prof)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{metadynminer_files/figure-latex/conv-1} 

}

\caption[Evolution of free energy differences]{Evolution of free energy differences. The free energy differences of minima B-E (relative to the global minimum A) converge to the exact free energy differences with the progress of the simulation. This plot helps to assess the accuracy of the predicted free energy differences.}\label{fig:conv}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

Beside minima, another important points on the free energy surface are
transition states. Change of the molecular structure from one minimum to
another takes place via a path with the lowest energy demand. The state
with the highest energy along this path is called the transition state.
Free energy difference between the initial and transition state can be
used to predict kinetics (rates) of the studied molecular process.
Furthermore, identification of transition states is important in drug
design because compounds designed to mimic the transition states of an
enzymatic reaction are often potent enzymes inhibitors and thus good
drug candidates \citep{relenza}.

In \CRANpkg{metadynminer}, such path can be identified by Nudged Elastic
Band method \citep{neb}. Briefly, this method plots a line between
selected minima as an initial approximation of the transition path.
Next, this line is curved so that the corresponding physical process
becomes feasible. This function can be applied on, for example, minima A
and D as:

\begin{verbatim}
  nebAD <- neb(minima, min1="A", min2="D")
\end{verbatim}

The result can be analyzed by \texttt{summary} (to provide kinetics of
the A to D and D to A change predicted by Eyring equation
\citep{eyring}), by \texttt{plot} (to plot the free energy profile of
the molecular process) and by \texttt{pointsonfes} or
\texttt{linesonfes} (to plot the path on top of the free energy
surface). The last example can be invoked by:

\begin{verbatim}
  plot(minima, xlab="phi", ylab="psi")
  linesonfes(nebAD, lwd=4)
\end{verbatim}

The resulting plot is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:neb}.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{metadynminer_files/figure-latex/neb-1} 

}

\caption[Path of transition from A to D projected onto free energy surface]{Path of transition from A to D projected onto free energy surface. This represents the most favorable path between these minima. It can be used to identify the transition state (the point with the highest energy on the path) and the rate of the transition.}\label{fig:neb}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

Let us also briefly present \CRANpkg{metadynminer3d}. This package uses
packages \CRANpkg{rgl} and \CRANpkg{misc3d} to plot the free energy
surface as an interactive (mouse rotatable) isosurface in the space of
three collective variables (see Figure \ref{fig:fes3d}).
\CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} can produce interactive WebGL visualizations
using \texttt{writeWebGL} command from the \CRANpkg{rgl} package.

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{fig8} 

}

\caption[3D free energy surface depicted as isosurface at -30 kJ/mol]{3D free energy surface depicted as isosurface at -30 kJ/mol. It is analogous to the 2D plot in Figure 4, but with three collective variables.}\label{fig:fes3d}
\end{figure}
\end{Schunk}

\CRANpkg{metadynminer} and \CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} were developed to be
highly flexible. This flexibility can be demonstrated on two examples.
First, it is useful to visualize the progress of metadynamics as a video
sequence showing the evolution of the free energy surface. The code to
generate corresponding images can be written in \CRANpkg{metadynminer}
as:

\begin{verbatim}
tfes <- fes(hillsfile, tmax=100)
png("snap%04d.png")
plot(tfes, zlim=c(-200,0))
for(i in 1:299) {
  tfes <- tfes+fes(acealanme, imin=100*i+1, imax=100*(i+1))
  plot(tfes, zlim=c(-200,0), xlab="phi", ylab="psi")
}
dev.off()
\end{verbatim}

This generates a series of images that can be concatenated by external
software to make a video file.

The second example demonstrates a more complicated analysis of the
results from metadynamics. Functions \texttt{fes} and \texttt{fes2} use
equations \eqref{eq:mtd} and \eqref{eq:wtmtd} to predict the free energy
surface. A limitation of this approach is that the prediction of the
free energy surface is based only on the positions of hills. The
evolution of collective variables between hills depositions is not used.
As an alternative, it is possible to use reweighting
\citep{us},\citep{tiwary}. This approach calculates the free energy
surface from hills positions as well as from evolution of collective
variables. Briefly, regions of the free energy surface that are sampled
despite being disfavored by high flooding potential have higher weights
than those disfavored by low flooding potential. This approach, in
general, is more accurate. A file containing values of collective
variables and the bias potential at different snapshots of the
simulation (default filename COLVAR) is required. Reweighting can be
done using the code:

\begin{verbatim}
bf <- 15
kT <- 8.314*300/1000
npoints <- 50
maxfes <- 75
outfes <- 0*fes(hillsfile, npoints=npoints)
step <- 1:50*length(hillsfile$time)/50
s1 <- sapply(step, FUN=function(x) {
          sum(exp(-fes(hillsfile, imax=x)$fes/kT))
})
s2 <- sapply(step, FUN=function(x) {
          sum(exp(-fes(hillsfile, imax=x)$fes/kT/bf))
})
ebetac <- s1/s2
cvs <- read.table("COLVAR")
nsamples <- nrow(cvs)
xlim <- c(-pi,pi)
ylim <- c(-pi,pi)
step <- (1:nsamples-1)*50/nsamples+1
ix <- npoints*(cvs[,2]-xlim[1])/(xlim[2]-xlim[1])+1
iy <- npoints*(cvs[,3]-ylim[1])/(ylim[2]-ylim[1])+1
for(i in 1:nsamples) {
  outfes$fes[ix[i],iy[i]] <- outfes$fes[ix[i],iy[i]] + exp(cvs[i,4]/kT)/
ebetac[step[i]]
}
outfes$fes <- -kT*log(outfes$fes)
outfes <- outfes - min(outfes)
outfes$fes[outfes$fes>maxfes] <- maxfes
plot(outfes, xlab="phi", ylab="psi")
\end{verbatim}

where \texttt{bf} is the bias factor (\((T+\Delta T)/T\) in Equation
\eqref{eq:wtmtd}), \texttt{kT} is temperature in Kelvins multiplied by
Boltzmann constant, \texttt{npoints} is the granularity of the resulting
free energy surface and \texttt{maxfes} is the maximal possible free
energy (to avoid problems with infinite free energy in unsampled
regions). First, \texttt{outfes} is introduced as a zero free energy
surface. First, the correction \texttt{ebetac} for the evolution of
flooding potential developed by Tiwary and Parrinello \citep{tiwary} is
calculated. Next, a file with the evolution of collective variables
COLVAR (from the same simulation used to generate \texttt{acealanme}
dataset, available at
\url{https://www.metadynamics.cz/metadynminer/data/}) is read. The
second loop evaluates the sampling weighted by the factor
\(\exp (V(s)/kT)\) divided by \texttt{ebetac} to correct for the
evolution of the bias potential \citep{tiwary}. Finally, probabilities
are converted to the free energy surface and plotted (Figure
\ref{fig:rew}).

All simulations were done using Gromacs 2016.4 \citep{gmx} patched by
Plumed 2.4b \citep{plumed}. Alanine dipeptide was modeled using
Amber99SB-ILDN force field \citep{ildn}. The simulated system contained
alanine dipeptide and 874 TIP3P \citep{tip3p} water molecules. The
temperature was kept constant at 300 K using Bussi thermostat
\citep{vrescale}. Metadynamics hills of height 1 kJ/mol (bias factor 10)
and widths 0.3 rad were added every 1 ps. Two simulations were done, one
with one dihedral angle \(\phi\) (dataset \texttt{acealanme1d}), two
dihedral angles \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) (dataset \texttt{acealanme}), or
with three angle \(\phi\), \(\phi\) and \(\omega\) (dataset

\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

The package \CRANpkg{metadynminer} and \CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} provides
fast algorithm Bias Sum \citep{petr} for calculation of free energy
surfaces from metadynamics. This algorithm is available in our on-line
tool MetadynView (\url{http://metadyn.vscht.cz}), but this tools is
intended for routine checking of the progress of metadynamics
simulations rather than for in-depth analysis and visualization. Besides
this, users of metadynamics use built-in functions in Plumed or various
in-lab scripts. Such scripts do not provide appropriate flexibility in
analysis and visualization.

The biggest advantage we see is in the fact that \CRANpkg{metadynminer}
can produce publication quality figures via graphics output functions in
R. As shown above, using a simple \texttt{for} loop it is possible to
plot individual snapshots and concatenate them outside R to make a
movie. \CRANpkg{metadynminer3d} provides the possibility to produce
interactive 3D web models by WebGL technology. We also tested 3D
printing of a free energy surface that is very easy using
\CRANpkg{metadynminer} and \CRANpkg{rayshader}. Various tips and tricks
can be found on the website of the project
(\url{https://www.metadynamics.cz/metadynminer/}).

Another advantage we see is in the reporting of results. Reproducibility
is a big issue in science, including molecular simulations. Packages
like \CRANpkg{knitr} or \CRANpkg{rmarkdown} ca be used to record all
steps of data analysis pipeline to compile a report for routine and
reproducible use of metadynamics.
