title: 'penPHcure: Variable Selection in Proportional Hazards Cure Model with Time-Varying
  Covariates'
abstract: |
  We describe the penPHcure R package, which implements the semiparametric proportional
  hazards (PH) cure model of Sy and Taylor (2000) extended to time-varying covariates and the variable
   selection technique based on its SCAD-penalized likelihood proposed by Beretta and Heuchenne
   (2019a). In survival analysis, cure models are a useful tool when a fraction of the population is likely to
   be immune from the event of interest. They can separate the effects of certain factors on the probability
   of being susceptible and on the time until the occurrence of the event. Moreover, the penPHcure
   package allows the user to simulate data from a PH cure model, where the event-times are generated
   on a continuous scale from a piecewise exponential distribution conditional on time-varying covariates,
   with a method similar to Hendry (2014). We present the results of a simulation study to assess the
   finite sample performance of the methodology and illustrate the functionalities of the penPHcure
   package using criminal recidivism data.
