Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

On behalf of all co-authors, attached please find our important and timely manuscript entitled “Estimating Causal Effect using the Bayesian Method with the R Package BayesCACE” to be considered for publication in the R Journal, coauthored by Jincheng Zhou, Jinhui Yang, James S Hodges, Lifeng Lin, and Haitao Chu. 

Given that we implemented our recently published Bayesian papers estimating Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] from a single trial and meta-analysis in R and published it as an R package in CRAN, we believe that our work is a great fit for consideration by the R Journal. Additionally, given the importance of our methods in accounting for the common problem of noncompliance in clinical trials and meta-analyses, we believe that our paper and package can have a high impact, particularly for applied statisticians and scientists who need to deal with noncompliance frequently in practice.

This manuscript is not published, nor is it under review for any other journal. All co-authors contributed to the design, analysis and/or writing of this manuscript. All co-authors have reviewed and approved the final version of the manuscript. Please feel free to let me know if you need any additional information. Thank you for your consideration.
