Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

I am pleased to submit the revised version of an original article (id 2022-38) titled "HostSwitch: An R Package to Simulate the Extent of Host-Switching by a Consumer" by Trivellone V., Araujo S.B.L., Panassiti B. for publication in the R Journal.

In biology, the host switch process is a change in the host specificity of a consumer leading either to reduce or expand its host range. Recent studies showed that host-switching of parasites may explain the origin of novel associations and disease outbreaks. At the evolutionary time scale, the host switch is one important component driving speciation as well as may explain the observed incongruences of the paired phylogenies. The scientific community has a compelling need to disentangle the role and understand the consequences of the host switch events in many different fields of research, such as agricultural science and medical research.

We consider our article as particularly appropriate for The R-Journal as it describes a new R-package (HostSwitch) providing a user-friendly modeling tool to simulate the dispersion and host switch events of a consumer (e.g., parasite or herbivore) to a novel resource (host). This package will support researchers trying to answer fundamental questions in the field of epidemiology, ecology and other sub-branches of biology, as well as students engaged in learning activities. In addition, our package may be applied to other scientific disciplines (not strictly biology) that need an individual-based approach to simulate host switch scenarios, as discussed in the paper.

We included a separe file "Trivellone_etal_point-by-pointResponse.docx" with detailed point-by-point response to the reviewers.

I would like to confirm that neither the manuscript nor any parts of its content are currently under consideration or published in another journal. Each author has contributed substantially to the tasks involved in the paper, until its final editing. Thus, each of us endorses it and gives his or her approval to this submission.
Thank you for your interest and consideration.
