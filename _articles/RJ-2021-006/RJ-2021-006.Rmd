title: Assembling Pharmacometric Datasets in R - The puzzle Package
abstract: Pharmacometric analyses are integral components of the drug development
  process. The core of each pharmacometric analysis is a dataset. The time required
  to construct a pharmacometrics dataset can sometimes be higher than the effort required
  for the modeling per se. To simplify the process, the puzzle R package has been
  developed aimed at simplifying and facilitating the time consuming and error prone
  task of assembling pharmacometrics datasets. Puzzle consist of a series of functions
  written in R. These functions create, from tabulated files, datasets that are compatible
  with the formatting requirements of the gold standard non-linear mixed effects modeling
  software. With only one function, puzzle(), complex pharmacometrics databases can
  easily be assembled. Users are able to select from different absorption processes
  such as zeroand first-order, or a com bination of both. Furthermore, datasets containing
  data from one or more analytes, and/or one or more responses, and/or time dependent
  and/or independent covariates, and/or urine data can be simultaneously assembled.
  The puzzle package is a powerful and efficient tool that helps modelers, programmers
  and pharmacometricians through the challenging process of assembling pharmacometrics
  datasets.
