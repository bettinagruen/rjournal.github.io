title: 'gofCopula: Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae'
abstract: |
  The last decades show an increased interest in modeling various types of data through
   copulae. Different copula models have been developed, which lead to the challenge of finding the
   best fitting model for a particular dataset. From the other side, a strand of literature developed a list
   of different Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) tests with different powers under different conditions. The usual
   practice is the selection of the best copula via the p-value of the GoF test. Although this method is not
   purely correct due to the fact that non-rejection does not imply acception, this strategy is favored by
   practitioners. Unfortunately, different GoF tests often provide contradicting outputs. The proposed
   R-package brings under one umbrella 13 most used copulae plus their rotated variants together
   with 16 GoF tests and a hybrid one. The package offers flexible margin modeling, automatized
   parallelization, parameter estimation, as well as a user-friendly interface, and pleasant visualizations
   of the results. To illustrate the functionality of the package, two exemplary applications are provided.
