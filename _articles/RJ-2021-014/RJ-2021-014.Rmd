title: 'miWQS: Multiple Imputation Using Weighted Quantile Sum Regression'
abstract: The miWQS package in the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) utilizes
  weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) in the multiple imputation (MI) framework.
  The data analyzed is a set/mixture of continuous and correlated components/chemicals
  that are reasonable to combine in an index and share a common outcome. These components
  are also interval-censored between zero and upper thresholds, or detection limits,
  which may differ among the components. This type of data is found in areas such
  as chemical epidemiological studies, sociology, and genomics. The miWQS package
  can be run using complete or incomplete data, which may be placed in the first quantile,
  or imputed using bootstrap or Bayesian approach. This article provides a stepwise
  and hands-on approach to handle uncertainty due to values below the detection limit
  in correlated component mixture problems.
