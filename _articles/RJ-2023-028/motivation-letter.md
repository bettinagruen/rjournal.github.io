Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip


We are writing to submit the revised version of the manuscript titled:"GCPBayes:  An R package for studying Cross-Phenotype Genetic Associations with Group-level Bayesian Meta-Analysis" co-authored by T. Baghfalaki, P.E. Sugier, Y. Asgari, T. Truong,  and B. Liquet for possible publication in the R Journal.

We greatly appreciated the careful reading of our paper and the many helpful suggestions made to improve our manuscript. We think that this revised version reflects all the concerns raised by the reviewers. We give in the following our point-by-point responses to all comments.
