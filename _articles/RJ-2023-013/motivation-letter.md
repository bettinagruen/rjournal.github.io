Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please reconsider our article titled "Generalized Mosaic Plots in the ggplot2
Framework" for publication in the R Journal. We responded to each revision request and detailed the subsequent changes made to the paper in the html file, "revisions", included in the submission.

This paper provides an overview of the implementation of ggmosaic. It features examples that go beyond describing how to use ggmosaic to create mosaic plots and demonstrates how to connect a the visual elements of a mosaic plot with the theoretical probabilities for a principled approach to revealing high-dimensional relationships in hierarchical visualizations. After introducing the package as it was initially released, we describe the new additions to ggmosaic, including additional geoms and a shiny application for interactively building mosaic plots and exploratory modeling. Most noteworthy, we introduce a novel method of incorporating a rendering of the underlying density via jittering, providing a connection to the individual observations and further extending the ability of generalized mosaic plots to communicate interesting features of high-dimensional categorical data. The paper concludes with an explanation of the shiny app provided in version 0.3.3 of ggmosaic for the interactive exploratory building of mosaic plots.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article, and the variety of examples it provides, helpful for learning about ggmosaic and mosaic plots in general.
