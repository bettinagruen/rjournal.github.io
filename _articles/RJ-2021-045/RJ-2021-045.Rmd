title: 'The R Package smicd: Statistical Methods for Interval-Censored Data'
abstract: |
  The package allows the use of two new statistical methods for the analysis of interval
  censored data: 1) direct estimation/prediction of statistical indicators and 2) linear (mixed) regression
   analysis. Direct estimation of statistical indicators, for instance, poverty and inequality indicators,
   is facilitated by a non parametric kernel density algorithm. The algorithm is able to account for
   weights in the estimation of statistical indicators. The standard errors of the statistical indicators are
   estimated with a non parametric bootstrap. Furthermore, the package offers statistical methods for
   the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression models with an interval-censored dependent
   variable, particularly random slope and random intercept models. Parameter estimates are obtained
   through a stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm. Standard errors are estimated using a
   non parametric bootstrap in the linear regression model and by a parametric bootstrap in the linear
   mixed regression model. To handle departures from the model assumptions, fixed (logarithmic) and
   data-driven (Box-Cox) transformations are incorporated into the algorithm.
