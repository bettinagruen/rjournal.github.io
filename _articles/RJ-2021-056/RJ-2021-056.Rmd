title: A Method for Deriving Information from Running R Code
abstract: |
  It is often useful to tap information from a running R script. Obvious use cases include
   monitoring the consumption of resources (time, memory) and logging. Perhaps less obvious cases
   include tracking changes in R objects or collecting the output of unit tests. In this paper, we demonstrate
   an approach that abstracts the collection and processing of such secondary information from the
   running R script. Our approach is based on a combination of three elements. The first element is
   to build a customized way to evaluate code. The second is labeled local masking and it involves
   temporarily masking a user-facing function so an alternative version of it is called. The third element
   we label local side effect. This refers to the fact that the masking function exports information to the
   secondary information flow without altering a global state. The result is a method for building systems
   in pure R that lets users create and control secondary flows of information with minimal impact on
   their workflow and no global side effects.
