title: 'RLumCarlo: Simulating Cold Light using Monte Carlo Methods'
abstract: |
  The luminescence phenomena of insulators and semiconductors (e.g., natural minerals such
   as quartz) have various application domains. For instance, Earth Sciences and archaeology exploit
   luminescence as a dating method. Herein, we present the R package RLumCarlo implementing sets of
   luminescence models to be simulated with Monte Carlo (MC) methods. MC methods make a powerful
   ally to all kinds of simulation attempts involving stochastic processes. Luminescence production
   is such a stochastic process in the form of charge (electron-hole pairs) interaction within insulators
   and semiconductors. To simulate luminescence-signal curves, we distribute single and independent
   MC processes to virtual MC clusters. RLumCarlo comes with a modularized design and consistent
   user interface: (1) C++ functions represent the modeling core and implement models for specific
   stimulations modes. (2) R functions give access to combinations of models and stimulation modes,
   start the simulation and render terminal and graphical feedback. The combination of MC clusters
   supports the simulation of complex luminescence phenomena.
