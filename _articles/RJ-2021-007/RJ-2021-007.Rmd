title: 'RNGforGPD: An R Package for Generation of Univariate and Multivariate Generalized
  Poisson Data'
abstract: This article describes the R package RNGforGPD, which is designed for the
  generation of univariate and multivariate generalized Poisson data. Some illustrative
  examples are given, the utility and functionality of the package are demonstrated;
  and its performance is assessed via simulations that are devised around both artificial
  and real data.
