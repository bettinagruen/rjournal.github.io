title: 'A Graphical EDA Tool with ggplot2: brinton'
abstract: We present brinton package, which we developed for graphical exploratory
  data analysis in R. Based on ggplot2, gridExtra and rmarkdown, brinton package introduces
  wideplot() graphics for exploring the structure of a dataset through a grid of variables
  and graphic types. It also introduces longplot() graphics, which present the entire
  catalog of available graphics for representing a particular variable using a grid
  of graphic types and variations on these types. Finally, it introduces the plotup()
  function, which complements the previous two functions in that it presents a particular
  graphic for a specific variable of a dataset. This set of functions is useful for
  understanding the structure of a data set, discovering unexpected properties in
  the data, evaluating different graphic representations of these properties, and
  selecting a particular graphic for display on the screen.
