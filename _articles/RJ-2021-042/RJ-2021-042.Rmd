title: Package wsbackfit for Smooth Backfitting Estimation of Generalized Structured
  Models
abstract: |
  A package is introduced that provides the weighted smooth backfitting estimator for
  a large family of popular semiparametric regression models. This family is known as generalized
  structured models, comprising, for example, generalized varying coefficient model, generalized
  additive models, mixtures, potentially including parametric parts. The kernel-based weighted
  smooth backfitting belongs to the statistically most efficient procedures for this model class. Its
  asymptotic properties are well-understood thanks to the large body of literature about this estimator.
  The introduced weights allow for the inclusion of sampling weights, trimming, and efficient estimation
  under heteroscedasticity. Further options facilitate easy handling of aggregated data, prediction,
  and the presentation of estimation results. Cross-validation methods are provided which can be used
  for model and bandwidth selection.1
