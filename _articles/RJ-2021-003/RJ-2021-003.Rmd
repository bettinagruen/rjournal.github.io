title: 'A Unified Algorithm for the Non-Convex Penalized Estimation: The ncpen Package'
abstract: Various R packages have been developed for the non-convex penalized estimation
  but they can only be applied to the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) or
  minimax concave penalty (MCP). We develop an R package, entitled ncpen, for the
  non-convex penalized estimation in order to make data analysts to experience other
  non-convex penalties. The package ncpen implements a unified algorithm based on
  the convex concave procedure and modified local quadratic approximation algorithm,
  which can be applied to a broader range of non-convex penalties, including the SCAD
  and MCP as special examples. Many user-friendly functionalities such as generalized
  information criteria, cross-validation and ridge regularization are provided also.
