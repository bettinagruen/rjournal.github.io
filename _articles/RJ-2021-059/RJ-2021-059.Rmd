title: The HBV.IANIGLA Hydrological Model
abstract: |
  Over the past 40 years, the HBV (Hydrologiska Byr√•ns Vattenbalansavdelning) hydrological
   model has been one of the most used worldwide due to its robustness, simplicity, and reliable results.
   Despite these advantages, the available versions impose some limitations for research studies in
   mountain watersheds dominated by ice-snow melt runoff (i.e., no glacier module, a limited number of
   elevation bands, among other constraints). Here we present HBV.IANIGLA, a tool for hydroclimatic
   studies in regions with steep topography and/or cryospheric processes which provides a modular
   and extended implementation of the HBV model as an R package. To our knowledge, this is the first
   modular version of the original HBV model. This feature can be very useful for teaching hydrological
   modeling, as it offers the possibility to build a customized, open-source model that can be adjusted to
   different requirements of students and users.
