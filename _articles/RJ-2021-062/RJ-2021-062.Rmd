title: Unidimensional and Multidimensional Methods for Recurrence Quantification Analysis
  with crqa
abstract: |
  Recurrence quantification analysis is a widely used method for characterizing patterns in
   time series. This article presents a comprehensive survey for conducting a wide range of recurrence
  based analyses to quantify the dynamical structure of single and multivariate time series and capture
   coupling properties underlying leader-follower relationships. The basics of recurrence quantification
   analysis (RQA) and all its variants are formally introduced step-by-step from the simplest auto
  recurrence to the most advanced multivariate case. Importantly, we show how such RQA methods can
   be deployed under a single computational framework in R using a substantially renewed version of
   our crqa 2.0 package. This package includes implementations of several recent advances in recurrence
  based analysis, among them applications to multivariate data and improved entropy calculations
   for categorical data. We show concrete applications of our package to example data, together with a
   detailed description of its functions and some guidelines on their usage.
