title: 'krippendorffsalpha: An R Package for Measuring Agreement Using Krippendorff''s
  Alpha Coefficient'
abstract: |
  R package krippendorffsalpha provides tools for measuring agreement using Krippendorff’s
   α coefficient, a well-known nonparametric measure of agreement (also called inter-rater reliability
   and various other names). This article first develops Krippendorff’s α in a natural way and situates
   α among statistical procedures. Then, the usage of package krippendorffsalpha is illustrated via
   analyses of two datasets, the latter of which was collected during an imaging study of hip cartilage.
   The package permits users to apply the α methodology using built-in distance functions for the
   nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio levels of measurement. User-defined distance functions are also
   supported. The fitting function can accommodate any number of units, any number of coders, and
   missingness. Bootstrap inference is supported, and the bootstrap computation can be carried out in
   parallel.
