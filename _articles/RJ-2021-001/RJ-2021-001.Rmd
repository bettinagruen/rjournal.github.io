title: 'The biglasso Package: A Memory- and Computation-Efficient Solver for Lasso
  Model Fitting with Big Data in R'
abstract: Penalized regression models such as the lasso have been extensively applied
  to analyzing high-dimensional data sets. However, due to memory limitations, existing
  R packages like glmnet and ncvreg are not capable of fitting lasso-type models for
  ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that are increasingly seen in many
  areas such as genetics, genomics, biomedical imaging, and high-frequency finance.
  In this research, we implement an R package called biglasso that tackles this challenge.
  biglasso utilizes memory-mapped files to store the massive data on the disk, only
  reading data into memory when necessary during model fitting, and is thus able to
  handle out-of core computation seamlessly. Moreover, itâ€™s equipped with newly proposed,
  more efficient feature screening rules, which substantially accelerate the computation.
  Benchmarking experiments show that our biglasso package, as compared to existing
  popular ones like glmnet, is much more memory and computation-efficient. We further
  analyze a 36 GB simulated GWAS data set on a laptop with only 16 GB RAM to demonstrate
  the out-of-core computation capability of biglasso in analyzing massive data sets
  that cannot be accommodated by existing R packages.
