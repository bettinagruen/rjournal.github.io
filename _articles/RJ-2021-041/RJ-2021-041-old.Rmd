title: Finding Optimal Normalizing Transformations via bestNormalize
abstract: |
  The bestNormalize R package was designed to help users find a transformation that can
  effectively normalize a vector regardless of its actual distribution. Each of the many normalization
  techniques that have been developed has its own strengths and weaknesses, and deciding which to
  use until data are fully observed is difficult or impossible. This package facilitates choosing between
  a range of possible transformations and will automatically return the best one, i.e., the one that
  makes data look the most normal. To evaluate and compare the normalization efficacy across a suite
  of possible transformations, we developed a statistic based on a goodness of fit test divided by its
  degrees of freedom. Transformations can be seamlessly trained and applied to newly observed data
  and can be implemented in conjunction with caret and recipes for data preprocessing in machine
  learning workflows. Custom transformations and normalization statistics are supported.
