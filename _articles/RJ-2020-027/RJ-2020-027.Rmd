title: "spinifex: An R Package for Creating a Manual Tour of Low-dimensional Projections
      of Multivariate Data"
abstract: |
  Dynamic low-dimensional linear projections of multivariate
  data collectively known as tours provide an important tool for exploring
  multivariate data and models. The R package tourr provides functions
  for several types of tours: grand, guided, little, local and frozen. Each of
  these can be viewed dynamically, or saved into a data object for
  animation. This paper describes a new package, spinifex, which provides
  a manual tour of multivariate data where the projection coefficient of a single
  variable is controlled. The variable is rotated fully into the projection,
  or completely out of the projection. The resulting sequence of projections
  can be displayed as an animation, with functions from either the plotly
  or gganimate packages. By varying the coefficient of a single variable, it is
  possible to explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection
  to that variable. This is particularly useful when used with a projection
  pursuit guided tour to simplify and understand the solution. The use of the
  manual tour is applied particle physics data to illustrate the sensitivity
  of structure in a projection to specific variable contributions.
