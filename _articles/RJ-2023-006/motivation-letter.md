Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "OTrecod: An R package for Data Fusion using Optimal Transportation Theory" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces a new package called `OTrecod` dedicated to the solving of recoding problems in data fusion area.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it describes the functionalities of the package on a concrete example and thus constitute a companion paper that will assist them step by step in their future data fusion projects.
