Dear Professor Cook, \bigskip

Please consider our article titled "rassta: Raster-based Spatial
Stratification Algorithms" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called rassta, which provides
functions to perform landscape stratification, sampling, and modeling of
environmental data in R.

We believe that the readers of the R Journal will find this article
helpful for their work because it showcases the analysis of
environmental phenomena using functions explicitly designed for
geospatial data. Moreover, this article provides the theoretical
background of the functions in the rassta package. This background is
founded in ecological concepts proposed by many authors from diverse
disciplines.
