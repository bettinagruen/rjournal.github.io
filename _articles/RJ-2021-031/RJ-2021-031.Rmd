title: 'exPrior: An R Package for the Formulation of Ex-Situ Priors'
abstract: |
  The exPrior package implements a procedure for formulating informative priors of geo
  statistical properties for a target field site, called ex-situ priors and introduced in Cucchi et al. (2019).
   The procedure uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to assimilate multiple types of data coming from
   multiple sites considered as similar to the target site. This prior summarizes the information contained
   in the data in the form of a probability density function that can be used to better inform further
   geostatistical investigations at the site. The formulation of the prior uses ex-situ data, where the data
   set can either be gathered by the user or come in the form of a structured database. The package is
   designed to be flexible in that regard. For illustration purposes and for easiness of use, the package is
   ready to be used with the worldwide hydrogeological parameter database (WWHYPDA) Comunian
   and Renard (2009).
