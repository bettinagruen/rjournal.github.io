title: 'SEEDCCA: An Integrated R-Package for Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial
  Least Squares'
abstract: |
  Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has a long history as an explanatory statistical method
   in high-dimensional data analysis and has been successfully applied in many scientific fields such as
   chemometrics, pattern recognition, genomic sequence analysis, and so on. The so-called seedCCA is a
   newly developed R package that implements not only the standard and seeded CCA but also partial
   least squares. The package enables us to fit CCA to large-p and small-n data. The paper provides a
   complete guide. Also, the seeded CCA application results are compared with the regularized CCA in
   the existing R package. It is believed that the package, along with the paper, will contribute to high
  dimensional data analysis in various science field practitioners and that the statistical methodologies
   in multivariate analysis become more fruitful.
