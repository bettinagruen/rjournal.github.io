    abstract: '  Abstract The 4 Parameter Logistic (4PL) model has been recognized
      as a major tool to analyze the            relationship between doses and responses
      in pharmacological experiments. A main strength of this            model is
      that each parameter contributes an intuitive meaning enhancing interpretability
      of a fitted            model. However, implementing the 4PL model using conventional
      statistical software often encounters            numerical errors. This paper
      highlights the issue of convergence failure and presents several causes            with
      solutions. These causes include outliers and a non-logistic data shape, so useful
      remedies such            as robust estimation, outlier diagnostics and constrained
      optimization are proposed. These features            are implemented in a new
      R package dr4pl (Dose-Response analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic            model)
      whose code examples are presented as a separate section. Our R package dr4pl
      is shown to            work well for data sets where the traditional dose-response
      modelling packages drc and nplr fail.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The gold standard of experimental research is the randomized
      control trial. However,            interventions are often implemented without
      a randomized control group for practical or ethical            reasons. Propensity
      score matching (PSM) is a popular method for minimizing the effects of a            randomized
      experiment from observational data by matching members of a treatment group
      to similar            candidates that did not receive the intervention. Traditional
      PSM is not designed for studies that enroll            participants on a rolling
      basis and does not provide a solution for interventions in which the baseline            and
      intervention period are undefined in the comparison group. Rolling Entry Matching
      (REM) is a            new matching method that addresses both issues. REM selects
      comparison members who are similar            to intervention members with respect
      to both static (e.g., race) and dynamic (e.g., health conditions)            characteristics.
      This paper will discuss the key components of REM and introduce the rollmatch
      R            package.'

      problems using orthogonality            constrained optimization approach. The
      package serves as a unified framework for many regression            and survival
      analysis dimension reduction models that utilize semiparametric estimating equations.            The
      main computational machinery of orthoDr is a first-order algorithm developed
      by Wen and            Yin (2012) for optimization within the Stiefel manifold.
      We implement the algorithm through Rcpp            and OpenMP for fast computation.
      In addition, we developed a general-purpose solver for such            constrained
      problems with user-specified objective functions, which works as a drop-in version
      of            optim(). The package also serves as a platform for future methodology

    abstract: '  Abstract The bayesdfa package provides a flexible Bayesian modeling
      framework for applying dy           namic factor analysis (DFA) to multivariate
      time-series data as a dimension reduction tool. The core            estimation
      is done with the Stan probabilistic programming language. In addition to being
      one of the            few Bayesian implementations of DFA, novel features of
      this model include (1) optionally modeling            latent process deviations
      as drawn from a Student-t distribution to better model extremes, and (2)            optionally
      including autoregressive and moving-average components in the latent trends.
      Besides            estimation, we provide a series of plotting functions to
      visualize trends, loadings, and model pre           dicted values. A secondary
      analysis for some applications is to identify regimes in latent trends. We            provide
      a flexible Bayesian implementation of a Hidden Markov Model — also written with
      Stan — to            characterize regime shifts in latent processes. We provide
      simulation testing and details on parameter            sensitivities in supplementary
      information.'

    abstract: '  Abstract This paper introduces package ConvergenceClubs, which implements
      functions to perform            the Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009) club convergence
      clustering procedure in a simple and reproducible            manner. The approach
      proposed by Phillips and Sul to analyse the convergence patterns of groups            of
      economies is formulated as a nonlinear time varying factor model that allows
      for different time            paths as well as individual heterogeneity. Unlike
      other approaches in which economies are grouped a            priori, it also
      allows the endogenous determination of convergence clubs. The algorithm, usage,
      and            implementation details are discussed.'

      SimCorrMix: Simulation of Correlated Data with Multiple

    bibauthor: Allison Fialkowski and Hemant Tiwari
    abstract: '  Abstract The SimCorrMix package generates correlated continuous (normal,
      non-normal, and mix           ture), binary, ordinal, and count (regular and
      zero-inflated, Poisson and Negative Binomial) variables            that mimic
      real-world data sets. Continuous variables are simulated using either Fleishman’s
      third           order or Headrick’s fifth-order power method transformation.
      Simulation occurs at the component            level for continuous mixture distributions,
      and the target correlation matrix is specified in terms of            correlations
      with components. However, the package contains functions to approximate expected            correlations
      with continuous mixture variables. There are two simulation pathways which calculate            intermediate
      correlations involving count variables differently, increasing accuracy under
      a wide range            of parameters. The package also provides functions to
      calculate cumulants of continuous mixture            distributions, check parameter
      inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and summarize and            plot
      simulated variables. SimCorrMix is an important addition to existing R simulation
      packages            because it is the first to include continuous mixture and
      zero-inflated count variables in correlated            data sets.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The cluster randomized trial (CRT) is a randomized controlled
      trial in which randomization            is conducted at the cluster level (e.g.
      school or hospital) and outcomes are measured for each            individual
      within a cluster. Often, the number of clusters available to randomize is small
      (≤ 20), which            increases the chance of baseline covariate imbalance
      between comparison arms. Such imbalance is            particularly problematic
      when the covariates are predictive of the outcome because it can threaten            the
      internal validity of the CRT. Pair-matching and stratification are two restricted
      randomization            approaches that are frequently used to ensure balance
      at the design stage. An alternative, less            commonly-used restricted
      randomization approach is covariate-constrained randomization. Covariate           constrained
      randomization quantifies baseline imbalance of cluster-level covariates using
      a balance            metric and randomly selects a randomization scheme from
      those with acceptable balance by the            balance metric. It is able to
      accommodate multiple covariates, both categorical and continuous. To            facilitate
      implementation of covariate-constrained randomization for the design of two-arm
      parallel            CRTs, we have developed the cvcrand R package. In addition,
      cvcrand also implements the clustered            permutation test for analyzing
      continuous and binary outcomes collected from a CRT designed with            covariate-constrained
      randomization. We used a real cluster randomized trial to illustrate the functions            included
      in the package.'

    abstract: '  Abstract The increasing availability of large but noisy data sets
      with a large number of heterogeneous            variables leads to the increasing
      interest in the automation of common tasks for data analysis. The            most
      time-consuming part of this process is the Exploratory Data Analysis, crucial
      for better domain            understanding, data cleaning, data validation,
      and feature engineering.                  There is a growing number of libraries
      that attempt to automate some of the typical Exploratory            Data Analysis
      tasks to make the search for new insights easier and faster. In this paper,
      we present a            systematic review of existing tools for Automated Exploratory
      Data Analysis (autoEDA). We explore            the features of fifteen popular
      R packages to identify the parts of analysis that can be effectively            automated
