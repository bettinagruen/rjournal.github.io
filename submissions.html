<h1>The R Journal: Submissions</h1>

<h2>Instructions for authors</h2>

<p>Please read the <a href="share/author-guide.pdf" target="_blank">Instructions for Authors</a>, which explains how to prepare an article for submission to <em>The R Journal</em>.</p>

<p>The following files provide the mandatory template for preparing an article for submission to the R Journal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>LaTeX style file: RJournal.sty.</li>

  <li>fake Master LaTeX file: RJwrapper.tex.</li>

  <li>article template: RJtemplate.tex (including figure: Rlogo-5.png
    and bibliography: RJreferences.bib).</li>
  <li>example typeset template file: RJwrapper_orig.pdf.</li>
</ul>

<p>Download <a href="share/RJtemplate.zip">the zip archive of template files</a> into a directory, run tools::texi2pdf inside R a couple of times on RJwrapper.tex to produce a file RJwrapper.pdf, which shows how the template file would be typeset in an issue of <emph>The R Journal</emph>.</p>

<p>Submissions not using this template will be rejected without consideration. Do check that you are using at least version 0.13 of the LaTeX style file: RJournal.sty; the current version is contained in <a href="share/RJtemplate.zip">the zip archive of template files</a>.</p>

<h2>Submit online</h2>

<h3>R journal submission</h3>

<p>To submit a new article to the R journal, please complete the
form linked below. Note that journal policy changed in early 2017, and submissions of the "add-on packages" type will henceforth be subject to more rigorous scrutiny. If you are making a submission of this type, you should prepare a letter explaining how you meet our <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/" target="_blank">stronger requirements</a> described prominently at the beginning of this website and in our <a href="share/author-guide.pdf" target="_blank">Instructions for Authors</a>.</p><p>If you have problems, first try to reduce the size of your submission zipfile as much as possible. If this does not help, please contact the
Editor-in-Chief at
<code>&lt;r-journal@r-project.org&gt;</code>. </p>

<p>Resubmission and revisions to accepted articles are received through
the same site where new submissions are received (link below). When
providing a resubmission or revision, please enter the identifier of 
the original submission in the last field of the submission form below.</p>
