<h1>Submissions</h1>
Please send submissions to regular columns (Programmer's Niche, Help
Desk) to the respective column editor, all other submissions to the
Editor-in-Chief or a member of the editorial board.
<p>Please read the <a href="latex/RJauthorguide.pdf">Instructions for Authors</a>, which explains how to prepare an article for submission to <span style="font-style: italic;">The R Journal</span>.
</p>
<p>
The following files provide a template
for preparing an article for submission to the R Journal:
<ul>
  <li> LaTeX style file:
       <a href="latex/RJournal.sty">RJournal.sty</a>.
  <li> fake Master LaTeX file:
       <a href="latex/RJwrapper.tex">RJwrapper.tex</a>.
  <li> article template:
       <a href="latex/RJtemplate.tex">RJtemplate.tex</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Download the files into a directory, run pdflatex a couple of times
on RJwrapper.tex to produce a file RJwrapper.pdf, which shows how the template file would be
typeset in an issue of <span style="font-style: italic;">The R Journal</span>.
You can also download a copy of <a href="latex/RJwrapper.pdf">RJwrapper.pdf</a>.

<p>The LaTeX style file used by <span style="font-style: italic;">The R Journal</span> is derived
from the source <a href="latex/RJournal.dtx">RJournal.dtx</a> and is documented in the file 
<a href="latex/RJournal.pdf">RJournal.pdf</a>.  These two files are made available for completeness,
and in order to comply with the license of docstrip.
You do not need them for a submission to <span style="font-style: italic;">The R Journal</span>.
