      <title>News from the Forwards Taskforce</title>
      <dc:creator>Heather Turner</dc:creator>
      <link>https://rjournal-distill.netlify.app/news/RJ-2021-2-forwards-news</link>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://forwards.github.io/"&gt;Forwards&lt;/a&gt; is an R Foundation
taskforce working to widen the participation of under-represented groups
in the R project and in related activities, such as the &lt;em&gt;useR!&lt;/em&gt;
conference. This report rounds up activities of the taskforce during the
second half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="accessibility"&gt;Accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a number of people have joined the taskforce with a particular
interest in accessibility, we have established a new Accessibility Team,
led by s gwynn sturdevant and Jonathan Godfrey. The team will address
accessibility to R and the R ecosystem in a broad sense, considering
barriers faced by people with disabilities, or working in situations
with limited internet access, or working in a language other than
English, to name some of the major issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their inaugural meeting in November, the team focused on improving
documentation and reference materials for screen-reader users and those
who prefer reading electronic documents in dark mode. Both issues are
best handled by creating documents in HTML format. Di Cook shared a
development version of The R Journal’s new HTML format, which was
welcomed enthusiastically by the group and there was agreement to work
together on testing and improving the journal’s accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of the new team is a continuation of the work Forwards has
done on accessibility in the past, primarily in the context of the useR!
conference. For 2021, Forwards members supported the organizers in their
efforts to ensure that presentation materials and conference tools were
accessible. Further detail is given in the blog posts &lt;a
href="https://user2021.r-project.org/blog/2021/12/07/accessibility_awards_interview/"&gt;Making
Accessible Presentations at useR! 2021: The Story Behind the Scenes&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a
href="https://user2021.r-project.org/blog/2021/11/04/accessibility_interview_liz_hare/"&gt;How
to Improve Conference Accessibility for Screen-reader Users - An
Interview with Liz Hare&lt;/a&gt;. Liz Hare has been working on a joint
project with Silvia Canelón as part of the &lt;a
href="https://mircommunity.com/"&gt;MiR community&lt;/a&gt;, promoting good
accessibility practices in data visualisation, a project that received
funding from &lt;a
href="https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/announcing-the-new-cohort-of-event-fund-grantees/"&gt;Code
for Science and Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="community-engagement"&gt;Community engagement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community team had a reboot in November, with Richard Ngamita
stepping up to join Kevin O’Brien as co-lead. The team plans to focus on
fostering networks in regions where the R community is less well
connected, in particular supporting the work of &lt;a
href="https://africa-r.org/"&gt;AfricaR&lt;/a&gt; and the new AsiaR community,
which has established a &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/join_asiaR_slack"&gt;Slack
Workspace&lt;/a&gt; and plans to hold regional online meetups in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key form of support is to encourage knowledge-sharing between
regions, for example, by nominating speakers from Africa or Asia for
speaking opportunities, or by joining events as a guest speaker. In
recent months, Forwards members &lt;a
href="https://twitter.com/minebocek/status/1434173671313190913"&gt;Mine
Çetinkaya-Rundel&lt;/a&gt; spoke at satRday Nairobi, &lt;a
href="https://twitter.com/HeathrTurnr/status/1459495802850746370"&gt;Heather
Turner&lt;/a&gt; spoke at the 1st anniversary of R-Ladies Nairobi, and &lt;a
href="https://twitter.com/RUsersGhana/status/1482079597214773248"&gt;Kevin
O’Brien&lt;/a&gt; spoke at the 3rd anniversary of Accra R User Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several members of the Community team are part of the R-Consortium
Diversity &amp;amp; Inclusion Working Group, led by Samantha Toet. This
group is currently working on four big projects: a guide to writing a
code of conduct; an event organizer checklist; a speaker directory, and
a &lt;a
href="https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2021/07/14/r-consortium-diversity-inclusion-speaker-nomination"&gt;speaker
nomination&lt;/a&gt; form for R Consortium-affiliated events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conferences-team"&gt;Conferences Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conferences team also gained a new lead, Yanina Bellini Saibene,
who has been involved in the organization of many R events and
conferences. Along with Natalia da Silva and Riva Quiroga, she chaired
the &lt;a href="https://latin-r.com/en"&gt;LatinR&lt;/a&gt; 2021 conference, which
took place online in November. Being online helped them to reach a
record 1000 registrants. Highlights of the program included several
papers from Spain, a full panel in Portuguese, and a full panel of Latin
American women package developers. This is a great advance from the
initial R Foundation endorsed event in 2018, which was a satellite to
the 47 JAIIO informatics conference, attended by 50 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Claudia Alejandra Huaylla from the Surveys
team, Yanina Bellini Saibene reflected in a blog post on &lt;a
href="https://user2021.r-project.org/blog/2021/11/26/latines_at_user/"&gt;the
Latin American Community at useR! 2021&lt;/a&gt;, describing an exceptional
increase in participation compared to previous years. They identify many
practices that facilitated this growth, starting with including Latin
American R users in the organizing team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several members of Forwards have been involved in the &lt;a
href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/participants"&gt;Google
Season of Docs project&lt;/a&gt; to develop a &lt;a
href="https://bit.ly/knowledgebase-rj"&gt;knowledgebase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
href="https://bit.ly/3fA5r61"&gt;information board&lt;/a&gt; to support the
organization of useR! conferences. In particular, Andrea Sánchez-Tapia
(co-lead of the Surveys team) and Noa Tamir (co-lead of the Conferences
team) were hired as writers on the project and they made sure that
diversity and inclusion were considered throughout the documentation.
The project built on a lot of previous work by Forwards, including the
annual surveys conducted at useR! and pieces of documentation written by
the Conferences team as part of their work to make useR! more inclusive.
Forwards will continue to be involved in maintaining these resources,
which have already gained attention from the organizers of other R
conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="on-ramps-team"&gt;On-ramps Team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Forwards &lt;a
href="https://github.com/forwards/first-contributions"&gt;first-contributions
repository&lt;/a&gt; walks people through making a simple pull request on
GitHub, a useful skill for contributing to R packages and other open
source software. Zane Dax updated the README with instructions in
Spanish in time for Hacktoberfest 2021, which encourages people to make
four quality pull requests to public GitHub and/or GitLab repositories
during October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R Contribution Working Group held an &lt;a
href="https://github.com/r-devel/rcontribution/blob/main/ideas_incubator.md"&gt;Ideas
Incubator&lt;/a&gt; over the summer to generate new ideas to work on during
2021/2022. One issue prioritised for attention was improving
communications. This led to further development of the R Contribution
Site, which is now hosted at &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/"
class="uri"&gt;https://contributor.r-project.org/&lt;/a&gt; and linked from the
main R Project website. The group has also set up the &lt;a
href="https://twitter.com/R_Contributors"&gt;@R_Contributors&lt;/a&gt; Twitter
account, for sharing event announcements and other news. The current
focus is to run some outreach events related to the &lt;a
href="https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/"&gt;R Development
Guide&lt;/a&gt;. Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal and Heather Turner are leading this
project, which is supported by a grant from Code for Science and
Society, as part of the &lt;a
href="https://incubator.codeforscience.org/cohort"&gt;Digital
Infrastructure Incubator&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that these events will provide
an on-ramp into a larger contributor event to run in parallel with useR!
2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="package-development-modules"&gt;Package Development Modules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Emma Rand ran a “train-the-trainer” event
in November/December aimed at R-Ladies leaders and others who wanted to
use the &lt;a
href="https://github.com/forwards/workshops/tree/master/package-dev-modules"&gt;Forwards
package development teaching materials&lt;/a&gt; with their user groups.
Attendees are starting to plan workshops based on the materials: a
course was run in early January 2022 by R-Ladies NYC (lead by Joyce
Robbins, assisted by Erin Grand and Emily Dodwell) and a course is
currently underway by R-Ladies Remote (lead by Heather Turner and Rita
Giordano).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changes-in-membership"&gt;Changes in Membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="new-members"&gt;New members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We welcome the following members to the taskforce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conferences team: Yanina Bellini Saibene (co-leader)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surveys team: Andrea Sánchez-Tapia (co-leader)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="previous-members"&gt;Previous members&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following members have stepped down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community team: Madlene Hamilton, Ileena Mitra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-ramps team: Jenny Bryan (co-leader)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social media team: Lorna Maria Aine (co-leader), Shakirah Nakalungi
(co-leader), Wenfeng Qin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surveys team: David Meza&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaching team: Yizhe Xu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thank them for their contribution to the taskforce. We also
acknowledge the work of Emily Dodwell, who has stepped down as
administrator after serving for several years (remaining a member of the
Teaching team) – s gwynn sturdevant has taken on this role.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The third annual R/Medicine conference was planned as a physical event to be held in Philadelphia at the end of August 2020. However, a nationwide lockdown induced by the COVID-19 pandemic required a swift transition to a virtual conference. This article  describes the challenges and benefits we encountered with this transition and provides an overview of the conference content.</description>
