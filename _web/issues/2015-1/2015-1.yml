  abstract: '  Abstract Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are a promising source of antibiotics
    with a broad spectrum            activity against bacteria and low incidence of
    developing resistance. The mechanism by which an            AMP executes its function
    depends on a set of computable physicochemical properties from the amino            acid
    sequence. The Peptides package was designed to allow the quick and easy computation
    of ten            structural characteristics own of the antimicrobial peptides,
    with the aim of generating data to increase            the accuracy in classification
    and design of new amino acid sequences. Moreover, the options to read            and
    plot XVG output files from GROMACS molecular dynamics package are included.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Fan charts, first developed by the Bank of England in 1996,
    have become a standard method            for visualising forecasts with uncertainty.
    Using shading fan charts focus the attention towards the            whole distribution
    away from a single central measure. This article describes the basics of plotting            fan
    charts using an R add-on package alongside some additional methods for displaying
    sequential            distributions. Examples are based on distributions of both
    estimated parameters from a time series            model and future values with
    uncertainty.'

  abstract: '  Abstract                  Visual analysis of data is important to understand
    the main characteristics, main trends and            relationships in data sets
    and it can be used to assess the data quality. Using the R package sparkTable,            statistical
    tables holding quantitative information can be enhanced by including spark-type
    graphs            such as sparklines                and sparkbars              .                  These
    kind of graphics are well-known in literature and are considered as simple, intense
    and            illustrative graphs that are small enough to fit in a single line.
    Thus, they can easily enrich tables and            texts with additional information
    in a comprehensive visual way.                  The R package sparkTable uses
    a clean S4 class design and provides methods to create different            types
    of sparkgraphs that can be used in websites, presentations and documents. We also
    implemented            an easy way for non-experts to create highly complex tables.
    In this case, graphical parameters can be            interactively changed, variables
    can be sorted, graphs can be added and removed in an interactive            manner.
    Thereby it is possible to produce custom-tailored graphical tables – standard
    tables that are            enriched with graphs – that can be displayed in a browser
    and exported to various formats.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This article describes the R package rdrobust, which provides
    data-driven graphical and in           ference procedures for RD designs. The
    package includes three main functions: rdrobust, rdbwselect            and rdplot.
    The first function (rdrobust) implements conventional local-polynomial RD treatment            effect
    point estimators and confidence intervals, as well as robust bias-corrected confidence
    intervals,            for average treatment effects at the cutoff. This function
    covers sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD            and fuzzy kink RD designs,
    among other possibilities. The second function (rdbwselect) implements            several
    bandwidth selectors proposed in the RD literature. The third function (rdplot)
    provides            data-driven optimal choices of evenly-spaced and quantile-spaced
    partition sizes, which are used to            implement several data-driven RD

  abstract: '  Abstract Data from complex survey designs require special consideration
    with regard to estimation            of finite population parameters and corresponding
    variance estimation procedures, as a consequence            of significant departures
    from the simple random sampling assumption. In the past decade a number            of
    statistical software packages have been developed to facilitate the analysis of
    complex survey            data. All these statistical software packages are able
    to treat samples selected from one sampling            frame containing all population
    units. Dual frame surveys are very useful when it is not possible to            guarantee
    a complete coverage of the target population and may result in considerable cost
    savings            over a single frame design with comparable precision. There
    are several estimators available in the            statistical literature but
    no existing software covers dual frame estimation procedures. This gap is now            filled
    by package Frames2. In this paper we highlight the main features of the package.
    The package            includes the main estimators in dual frame surveys and
    also provides interval confidence estimation.'

  abstract: '  Abstract This article introduces the showtext package that makes it
    easy to use system fonts in R            graphics. Unlike other methods to embed
    fonts into graphics, showtext converts text into raster images            or polygons,
    and then adds them to the plot canvas. This method produces platform-independent            image
    files that do not rely on the fonts that create them. It supports a large number
    of font formats            and R graphics devices, and meanwhile provides convenient
    features such as using web fonts and            integrating with knitr. This article
    provides an elaborate introduction to the showtext package,            including
    its design, usage, and examples.'

  abstract: '  Abstract Correspondence analysis on generalised aggregated lexical
    tables (CA-GALT) is a method            that generalizes classical CA-ALT to the
    case of several quantitative, categorical and mixed variables.            It aims
    to establish a typology of the external variables and a typology of the events
    from their mutual            relationships. In order to do so, the influence of
    external variables on the lexical choices is untangled            cancelling the
    associations among them, and to avoid the instability issued from multicollinearity,
    they            are substituted by their principal components. The CaGalt function,
    implemented in the FactoMineR            package, provides numerous numerical
    and graphical outputs. Confidence ellipses are also provided            to validate
    and improve the representation of words and variables. Although this methodology
    was            developed mainly to give an answer to the problem of analyzing
    open-ended questions, it can be            applied to any kind of frequency/contingency
    table with external variables.'

  abstract: '  Abstract True to their functional roots, most R functions are side-effect-free,
    and users expect datatypes            to be persistent. However, these semantics
    complicate the creation of efficient and dynamic data            structures. Here,
    we describe the implementation of stack and queue data structures satisfying these            conditions
    in R, available in the CRAN package rstackdeque. Guided by important work in purely            functional
    languages, we look at both partiallyand fully-persistent versions of queues, comparing            their
    performance characteristics. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of such dynamic
    structures with            examples of generating and solving mazes.'

  abstract: '  Abstract There is an ever-increasing number of applications, which
    use quantitative PCR (qPCR) or            digital PCR (dPCR) to elicit fundamentals
    of biological processes. Moreover, quantitative isother           mal amplification
    (qIA) methods have become more prominent in life sciences and point-of-care           diagnostics.
    Additionally, the analysis of melting data is essential during many experiments.
    Several            software packages have been developed for the analysis of such
    datasets. In most cases, the software            is either distributed as closed
    source software or as monolithic block with little freedom to perform            highly
    customized analysis procedures. We argue, among others, that R is an excellent
    foundation            for reproducible and transparent data analysis in a highly
    customizable cross-platform environment.            However, for novices it is
    often challenging to master R or learn capabilities of the vast number            of
    packages available. In the paper, we describe exemplary workflows for the analysis
    of qPCR,            qIA or dPCR experiments including the analysis of melting
    curve data. Our analysis relies entirely            on R packages available from
    public repositories. Additionally, we provide information related to            standardized
    and reproducible research.'

    with            little experience with statistical programming, but has more advanced
    features which are suitable for            a large number of more complex applications.
    In this paper, we introduce and motivate discreteRV,            describe its functionality,
    and provide reproducible examples illustrating its use.'

  abstract: '  Abstract When a linear model is rank-deficient, then predictions based
    on that model become            questionable because not all predictions are uniquely
    estimable. However, some of them are, and the            estimability package
    provides tools that package developers can use to tell which is which. With the            use
    of these tools, a model object’s predict method could return estimable predictions
    as-is while            flagging non-estimable ones in some way, so that the user
    can know which predictions to believe. The            estimability package also
    provides, as a demonstration, an estimability-enhanced epredict method            to
    use in place of predict for models fitted using the stats package.'
