It features short to medium length\narticles (up to 20 pages) covering topics of interest to users and\ndevelopers of R. For example, description and implementation details of\nR packages, surveys or reviews of R software related to a particular\narea, applications of R software or descriptions of teaching resources\nrelated to R.\nThe R Journal reaches a wide audience and has a thorough review\nprocess. It has a generally increasing SJR\nimpact factor. Papers are expected to be concise, clearly written,\nnot too technical, clearly related R, and follow reproducible practices.\nAdditional technical details and examples could be included as\nsupplementary material. Authors of refereed articles should take care\nto:\nput their contribution in context, in particular discuss related R\nfunctions or packages;\nexplain the motivation for their contribution;\nprovide code to reproduce the material in the paper.\n\nArticle types\nThe R Journal accepts a variety of article topics including:\n\nPackages: Details of contributed R packages that are available on\nCRAN or Bioconductor, that go beyond a package vignette. This includes\nproviding the broader context, implementation details, applications or\nexamples of use, with the purpose being to make the work relevant to a\nwider readership than only the package users. The paper might explain\nthe novelty in implementation and use of R, introduce new data\nstructures or general architectures that could be re-usable for other R\nprojects.\nReviews and proposals: surveying and discussing challenges and\nopportunities of potential importance for the broader R community,\nincluding proposals and proof-of-concept implementations.\nComparisons and benchmarking: of implementations in base-R and\ncontributed packages with each other, and where relevant with\nimplementations in other software systems.\nApplications: demonstrating how new or existing techniques can be\napplied in an area of current interest using R, providing a fresh view\nof such analyses in R that is of benefit beyond the specific\napplication.\nSpecial issue articles: papers associated with a conference like\nR Medicine, or possibly a collection of papers on a particular topic of\ninterest.\nHistory\nThe R Journal was established in 2009, superseding the R News. For\nhistorical purposes it also a news section, that includes items from R\nCore, updates from CRAN and Bioconductor, foRwards activiies and\nconference reports.\nEditorial board\nEditor-in-Chief\nDi Cook, Monash University, Australia r-journal@r-project.org\nExecutive editors\nCatherine Hurley, Maynooth University, Ireland\nSimon Urbanek, The University of Auckland, New Zealand\nMichael Kane, Yale University, USA\nGavin Simpson, Aarhus University, Denmark\nAssociate editors\nRafael de Andrade Moral, Maynooth University, Ireland\nLouis Aslett, Durham University, UK\nElizabeth Atkinson, Mayo Clinic, USA\nRasmus Bååth, Lund University, Sweden\nPrzemek Biecek, University of Warsaw, Poland\nChris Brunsdon, Maynooth University, Ireland\nMine Çetinkaya-Rundel, Duke University, USA\nXiaoyue Cheng, University of Nebraska, Omaha, USA\nKatarina Domijan, Maynooth University, Ireland\nIsabella Gollini, University College Dublin, Ireland\nKieran Healy, Duke University, USA\nAdam Loy, Carleton University, USA\nElizabeth Sweeney, Cornell University, USA\nPriyanga Dilini Talagala, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka\nEmi Tanaka, Monash University, Australia\nNicholas Tierney, Telethon Kids, Australia\nMark van der Loo, Statistics Netherlands, the Netherlands\nSusan Vanderplas, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA\nEaro Wang, The University of Auckland, New Zealand\nEmily Zabor, The Cleveland Clinic and Tassig Cancer Institute,\nUSA\nEditorial advisory board\nRoger Bivand, Norwegian School of Economics, Bergen, Norway\nMichael Lawrence, Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, USA\nBettina Grün, Johannes Kepler Universität Linz, Austria\nDeepayan Sarkar, Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi, India\nFriedrich Leisch, University of Natural Resources and Life -\nSciences, Vienna, Austria\nHadley Wickham, RStudio, Houston, Texas, USA\nHeather Turner, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK\nJohn Fox, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada\nKurt Hornik, WU Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Vienna, Austria\nPaul Murrell, University of Auckland, New Zealand\nPeter Dalgaard, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark\nMartyn Plummer, University of Warwick, UK\nVincent Carey, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA\nTorsten Hothorn, University of Zurich, Switzerland\nGovernance\nThe R Journal is run under the auspices of the R Foundation, and\neditors of the Journal are appointed by the Foundation board.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\nd-article > * {\n    grid-column: page;\n}\n\nArticles for the R Journal are short to medium length, no more than\n20 pages, on topics of interest to the R community. The submission needs\nto include:\npaper files to build the article including the .Rmd,\n.tex, .bib, .sty, figures, and\nthe output files .html, .pdf.\nfiles to reproduce the results presented in the paper, including R\nscripts, and data.\nmotivating letter that describes why your paper is suitable for the\nconsideration by the R Journal.\nif needed, supplementary files that might include additional\ntechnical details or examples.\n\nRead the information below on the requirements for files and format and\nthen CLICK\nHERE to submit an article, re-submission, or revision.\n\n\nWe are also keen to welcome new reviewers for the R Journal. If you\nwould like to volunteer to review articles, please complete this form\nhere. You should have at least completed an undergraduate degree,\nand be an active R user.\nCreating your article\nRmarkdown to output html and\npdf\nThe rjtools package\nhas a template to create the files needed for a submission in the form\nrequired by the R Journal.\nIt is strongly recommended that you use the\ncreate_article() function. Knitting the Rmd will generate\nboth an HTML and PDF format of your paper.\nWhen writing your article you should aim to write without specific\nreference to HTML and LaTeX codes. If you do need to write code specific\nto the HTML or PDF output, you can use\nknitr::is_html_output() and\nknitr::is_latex_output() to conditionally produce a\nparticular output.\nThe web articles for the R Journal are based on the distill\nframework, which provides several styling and arrangement options for\nyour article contents. The distill R package\ndocumentation (generally also applicable to articles written\nfor the R Journal) describes various article elements and Rmarkdown\nsyntax: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/.\nWe are especially looking for creative uses of interactive content in\nHTML formatted articles. This will require that you make different code\nchunks evaluated conditionally using\neval=knitr::is_html_output() or\neval=knitr::is_latex_output() with appropriate\nre-captioning, and conditional inline reference links. Interactive plots\nshould be produced with a manageable file size (aim for under 10Mb)\nwhich may require small data examples.\nConverting\nfrom rticles:rjournal_article Rmarkdown\nIf you currently use the rticles::rjournal_article\noutput format for R Markdown, the change involves five steps: (1) change\noutput formats to rjtools::rjournal_web_article to switch\nto the new style, (2) remove any latex specific functionality, (3)\nchange figure, table references to \\@ref() and (4) add the\nrjournal.csl and rjournal.css template files\nto your folder, updating YAML to utilise them, and (5) set the reference\nto the .bib in the YAML.\nTraditional latex format\nArticles can also be written using the traditional latex\ntemplate. Using this style you will need to provide RJwrapper.tex,\nRJwrapper.pdf, RJournal.sty, your-article.tex (which contains the\ncontent of your paper), your-article.bib, your-article.R (to reproduce\nresults in your paper), in addition to the motivation letter. You should\navoid using any other specialist latex style files. The\nrjtools check functions described below can also be applied\nto check your files prior to submission.\nChecking your article\nThe rjtools package has a number of functions which can\nhelp you check that your article is ready to submit. These include:\ninitial_check_article() does multiple checks on the\nfiles in your paper submission folder\ncheck_wrappers() that the files RJournal.tex and\nRJournal.pdf are present\ncheck_filenames() file names are consistent and as\nrequested\ncheck_unnecessary_files() that there are no extra files\nthan those necessary and requested\ncheck_cover_letter() there is a cover letter with the\nfiles to be submitted\ncheck_title() that the title is in title case\ncheck_section() that section headings are in sentence\ncase\ncheck_spelling() does a spell-check\ncheck_proposed_pkg() package is available on CRAN or\nbioconductor\ncheck_packages_available() additionally referenced\npackaged are also available on CRA or Bioconductor\n\nEach of these can also be run individually.\nFile format for submission\nNew submission\nTo submit a new article to the R Journal, you will need to complete.\nYou will need to provide these details:\nYour name.\nAn email address for the corresponding author. Try to ensure it is\nan address that will be available in the long term, through the review\nprocess and after the paper is published so that readers can contact you\nabout your work if desired.\nAn alternate email address, in case email to the primary address\ndoesn’t respond to editors requests.\nNames of all authors.\nArticle title.\nArticle type.\nArticle keywords/tags. You should be prepared to select at least one\nor two from the list (which is the same as the current CRAN Task Views)\nand you are free to add an additional words or phrases that accurately\ndescribe your paper.\nZip file containing:\npaper files to build the article including the .Rmd,\n.tex, .bib, .sty, figures.\nfile to reproduce the results, including R scripts, and data.\nmotivating letter that describes why your paper is suitable for the\nconsideration by the R Journal.\nreproducibility (supplementary) files in order that results reported\nin your paper can be reproduced, plus any additional files that contain\nadditional technical details for your work or extra examples.\n\nA list of the reproducibility and supplementary\nfiles, exactly as they are placed in your paper directory, to\nbe entered comma-delimited like\nmypaper.Rmd, data/mydata.rds, scripts/mycode.R, appendix.pdf.\nThis list is used to automatically build the .zip file that\nis distributed along with your paper as supplementary materials, when it\nis published. Thus it is important that you provide the comma-delimited\nfile names to streamline the build of your paper. If you have a lot of\ndata and code files you so that listing them all is prohibitive, you can\nzip them into one file to list. Note that, figure files are not\nconsidered supplementary materials for the R Journal.\nYou may have problems submitting if size of your submission zip file\nis more than 10Mb. If you have large files, for example, data files, you\ncan make them available on an alternative site and provide the links in\nthe paper. If you have problems, please contact the Editor-in-Chief at\nr-journal@r-project.org.\nYour paper will be checked for reproducibility by running the code\nprovided. Please ensure that the examples can be run in a timely manner,\nperhaps by reducing the example data size. If necessary, intermediate\noutput files, can be provided to shorten the run time.\nRe-submission or revision\nRe-submission and revisions to accepted articles are received through\nthe same site where new submissions are received (link below). When\nproviding a re-submission or revision, you will need to enter\nthe identifier of the original submission in the last field of\nthe submission form. This also needs to be done if your paper has\npreviously been rejected, and you have made appropriate corrections for\nit to be considered again.\nNote on special issue\narticles\nA special issue article can be considered to be a refereed journal\narticle and generally carries more weight than an unrefereed conference\nproceedings.\nConference committees will designate a “Conference Editor in Chief”\n(CEiC) who will be primarily responsible for putting the special issue\ntogether. For this pilot to be successful, it is important that putting\ntogether the special issue does not significantly increase the workload\nof the regular editors or the administrative team that helps to build\nthe issues. It will be the responsibility of the CEiC to identify\nassociate editors if needed, assign reviewers, accept and reject papers,\nand assemble the special issue. It will also be the responsibility of\nthe CEiC to make sure that the issue reflects the diversity of the\ncommunity, and that the R\nConsortium and R Community Code of Conduct is followed during the\nprocess.\n\n\n\n",
