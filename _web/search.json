It features short to medium length articles (up to 20 pages) covering topics of interest to users and developers of R. For example, description and implementation details of R packages, surveys or reviews of R software related to a particular area, applications of R software or descriptions of teaching resources related to R.\nThe R Journal reaches a wide audience and has a thorough review process. Papers are expected to be concise, clearly written, not too technical, clearly related R, and follow reproducible practices. Additional technical details and examples could be included as supplementary material. Authors of refereed articles should take care to:\nput their contribution in context, in particular discuss related R functions or packages;\nexplain the motivation for their contribution;\nprovide code to reproduce the material in the paper.\nR Journal’s impact factor is increasing, as reported by SJR, indicating the the journal is considered very useful and helpful by the academic community.\nArticle types\nThe R Journal accepts a variety of article topics including:\n\nReviews and proposals: surveying and discussing challenges and opportunities of potential importance for the broader R community, including proposals and proof-of-concept implementations.\nComparisons and benchmarking: of implementations in base-R and contributed packages with each other, and where relevant with implementations in other software systems.\nApplications: demonstrating how new or existing techniques can be applied in an area of current interest using R, providing a fresh view of such analyses in R that is of benefit beyond the specific application.\nPackages: Details of contributed R packages that are available on CRAN or Bioconductor, that go beyond a package vignette. This includes providing the broader context, implementation details, applications or examples of use, with the purpose being to make the work relevant to a wider readership than only the package users. The paper might explain the novelty in implementation and use of R, introduce new data structures or general architectures that could be re-usable for other R projects.\nSpecial issue articles: papers associated with a conference like R Medicine, or possibly a collection of papers on a particular topic of interest.\nHistory\nThe R Journal was established in 2009, superseding the R News. For historical purposes it also a news section, that includes items from R Core, updates from CRAN and Bioconductor, foRwards activiies and conference reports.\nEditorial board\nEditor-in-Chief\nDi Cook, Monash University, Australia r-journal@r-project.org\nExecutive editors\nCatherine Hurley, Maynooth University, Ireland\nSimon Urbanek, The University of Auckland, New Zealand\nMichael Kane, Yale University, USA\nGavin Simpson, Aarhus University, Denmark\nAssociate editors\nRafael de Andrade Moral, Maynooth University, Ireland\nLouis Aslett, Durham University, UK\nElizabeth Atkinson, Mayo Clinic, USA\nRasmus Bååth, Lund University, Sweden\nPrzemek Biecek, University of Warsaw, Poland\nXiaoyue Cheng, Univerity of Nebraska, Omaha, USA\nKatarina Domijan, Maynooth University, Ireland\nColin Gillespie, Newcastle University, UK\nIsabella Gollini, University College Dublin, Ireland\nAdam Loy, Carleton University, USA\nElizabeth Sweeney, Cornell University, USA\nPriyanga Dilini Talagala, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka\nNicholas Tierney, Telethon Kids, Australia\nMark van der Loo, Statistics Netherlands, the Netherlands\nSusan Vanderplas, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA\nEaro Wang, The University of Auckland, New Zealand\nEmily Zabor, The Cleveland Clinic and Tassig Cancer Institute, USA\nEditorial advisory board\nRoger Bivand, Norwegian School of Economics, Bergen, Norway\nMichael Lawrence, Genentech, Inc., San Francisco, USA\nBettina Grün, Johannes Kepler Universität Linz, Austria\nDeepayan Sarkar, Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi, India\nFriedrich Leisch, University of Natural Resources and Life - Sciences, Vienna, Austria\nHadley Wickham, RStudio, Houston, Texas, USA\nHeather Turner, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK\nJohn Fox, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada\nKurt Hornik, WU Wirtschaftsuniversität Wien, Vienna, Austria\nPaul Murrell, University of Auckland, New Zealand\nPeter Dalgaard, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark\nMartyn Plummer, University of Warwick, UK\nVincent Carey, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA\nTorsten Hothorn, University of Zurich, Switzerland\nGovernance\nThe R Journal is run under the auspices of the R Foundation, and editors of the Journal are appointed by the Foundation board.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\nd-article > * {\n    grid-column: page;\n}\n\nArticles for the R Journal are short to medium length, no more than 20 pages, on topics of interest to the R community. The submission needs to include:\npaper files to build the article including the .Rmd, .tex, .bib, .sty, figures.\nfile to reproduce the results, including R scripts, and data.\nmotivating letter that describes why your paper is suitable for the consideration by the R Journal.\nif needed, supplementary files that might include additional technical details or examples.\nRead the information below on the requirements for files and format and then CLICK HERE to submit an article, re-submission, or revision.\nCreating your article\nThe rjtools package has a template to create the files needed for a submission in the form required by the R Journal.\nIt is strongly recommended that you use the create_article() function. Knitting the Rmd will generate both an HTML and PDF format of your paper.\nIf you currently use the rticles::rjournal_article output format for R Markdown, you should be simply able to change output formats to rjtools::rjournal_web_article to switch to the new style.\nWhen writing your article you should aim to write without specific reference to HTML and LaTeX codes. If you do need to write code specific to the HTML or PDF output, you can use knitr::is_html_output() and knitr::is_latex_output() to conditionally produce a particular output.\nThe web articles for the R Journal are based on the [distill framework], which provides several styling and arrangement options for your article contents. The distill R package documentation (generally also applicable to articles written for the R Journal) describes how various article elements can be used: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/\nWe are especially looking for creative uses of interactive content in HTML formatted articles. This will require that you make different code chunks evaluated conditionally using eval=knitr::is_html_output() or eval=knitr::is_latex_output() with appropriate re-captioning, and conditional inline reference links. Interactive plots should be produced with a manageable file size (aim for under 10Mb) which may require small data examples.\nFor the immediate future, articles generated using the existing latex style will also be accepted.\nChecking your article\nThe rjtools package has a number of functions which can help you check that your article is ready to submit. These include:\ninitial_check_article() does multiple checks on the files in your paper submission folder\ncheck_wrappers() that the files RJournal.tex and RJournal.pdf are present\ncheck_filenames() file names are consistent and as requested\ncheck_unnecessary_files() that there are no extra files than those necessary and requested\ncheck_cover_letter() there is a cover letter with the files to be submitted\ncheck_title() that the title is in title case\ncheck_section() that section headings are in sentence case\ncheck_spelling() does a spell-check\ncheck_proposed_pkg() package is available on CRAN or bioconductor\ncheck_packages_available() additionally referenced packaged are also available on CRA or Bioconductor\n\nEach of these can also be run individually.\nFile format for submission\nNew submission\nTo submit a new article to the R Journal, you will need to complete. You will need to provide these details:\nYour name.\nAn email address for the corresponding author. Try to ensure it is an address that will be available in the long term, through the review process and after the paper is published so that readers can contact you about your work if desired.\nAn alternate email address, in case email to the primary address doesn’t respond to editors requests.\nNames of all authors.\nArticle title.\nArticle type.\nArticle keywords/tags. You should be prepared to select at least one or two from the list (current CRAN Task Views) and you are free to add an additional words or phrases that accurately describe your paper.\nZip file containing:\npaper files to build the article including the .Rmd, .tex, .bib, .sty, figures.\nfile to reproduce the results, including R scripts, and data.\nmotivating letter that describes why your paper is suitable for the consideration by the R Journal.\nif needed, supplementary files that might include additional technical details or examples.\n\nList of the supplementary files (as they are provided in your unzipped file set). These include any .Rmd, .R, data files like .csv, .rda, .rds, and supplementary documents that contain additional technical details for examples. It should NOT contain a list of figure files. This list is used to automatically build the .zip file that is distributed along with your paper, when it is published. Think about this as the list of files that contain all the other information that might be relevant for the reader of your article.\nYou may have problems submitting if size of your submission zip file is more than 10Mb. If you have large files, for example, data files, you can make them available on an alternative site and provide the links in the paper. If you have problems, please contact the Editor-in-Chief at r-journal@r-project.org.\nYour paper will be checked for reproducibility by running the code provided. Please ensure that the examples can be run in a timely manner, perhaps by reducing the example data size. If necessary, intermediate output files, can be provided to shorten the run time.\nRe-submission or revision\nRe-submission and revisions to accepted articles are received through the same site where new submissions are received (link below). When providing a re-submission or revision, you will need to enter the identifier of the original submission in the last field of the submission form. This also needs to be done if your paper has previously been rejected, and you have made appropriate corrections for it to be considered again.\nNote on special issue articles\nA special issue article can be considered to be a refereed journal article and generally carries more weight than an unrefereed conference proceedings.\nConference committees will designate a “Conference Editor in Chief” (CEiC) who will be primarily responsible for putting the special issue together. For this pilot to be successful, it is important that putting together the special issue does not significantly increase the workload of the regular editors or the administrative team that helps to build the issues. It will be the responsibility of the CEiC to identify associate editors if needed, assign reviewers, accept and reject papers, and assemble the special issue. It will also be the responsibility of the CEiC to make sure that the issue reflects the diversity of the community, and that the R Consortium and R Community Code of Conduct is followed during the process.\n\n\n\n",
