\title{SEEDCCA: An Integrated R-Package for Canonical Correlation
Analysis and Partial Least Squares}
\author{by Bo-Young Kim, Yunju Im, and Jae Keun Yoo}

\maketitle

\abstract{%
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has a long history as an
explanatory statistical method in high-dimensional data analysis and has
been successfully applied in many scientific fields such as
chemometrics, pattern recognition, genomic sequence analysis, and so on.
The so-called seedCCA is a newly developed R package that implements not
only the standard and seeded CCA but also partial least squares. The
package enables us to fit CCA to large-p and small-n data. The paper
provides a complete guide. Also, the seeded CCA application results are
compared with the regularized CCA in the existing R package. It is
believed that the package, along with the paper, will contribute to high
dimensional data analysis in various science field practitioners and
that the statistical methodologies in multivariate analysis become more
fruitful.
