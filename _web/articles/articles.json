    "description": "The goal of this paper is to help define a path toward a grammar for processing clinical trials by a) defining a format in which we would like to represent data from standardized clinical trial data b) describing a standard set of operations to transform clinical trial data into this format, and c) to identify a set of verbs and other functionality to facilitate data processing and encourage reproducibility in the processing of these data. It provides a background on standard clinical trial data and goes through a simple preprocessing example illustrating the value of the proposed approach through the use of the forceps package, which is currently being used for data of this kind.",

    "title": "fairmodels: a Flexible Tool for Bias Detection, Visualization, and Mitigation in Binary Classification Models",
    "description": "Machine learning decision systems are becoming omnipresent in our lives. From dating apps to rating loan seekers, algorithms affect both our well-being and future. Typically, however, these systems are not infallible. Moreover, complex predictive models are eager to learn social biases present in historical data that may increase discrimination. If we want to create models responsibly, we need tools for in-depth validation of models also from potential discrimination. This article introduces an R package fairmodels that helps to validate fairness and eliminate bias in binary classification models quickly and flexibly. The fairmodels package offers a model-agnostic approach to bias detection, visualization, and mitigation. The implemented functions and fairness metrics enable model fairness validation from different perspectives. In addition, the package includes a series of methods for bias mitigation that aim to diminish the discrimination in the model.  The package is designed to examine a single model and facilitate comparisons between multiple models.",

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nResponsible machine learning and, in particular, fairness is gaining attention within the machine learning community. This is because predictive algorithms are becoming more and more decisive and influential in our lives. This impact could be less or more significant in areas ranging from user feeds on social platforms, displayed ads, and recommendations at an online store to loan decisions, social scoring, and facial recognition systems used by police and authorities. Sometimes it leads to automated systems that learn some undesired bias preserved in data for some historical reason. Whether seeking a job (Lahoti et al. 2019) or having one’s data processed by court systems (Angwin et al. 2016), sensitive attributes such as sex, race, religion, ethnicity, etc., might play a significant role in the decision. Even if such variables are not directly included in the model, they are often captured by proxy variables such as zip code (a proxy for the race and wealth), purchased products (a proxy for gender and age), eye colour (a proxy for ethnicity). As one would expect, they can give an unfair advantage to a privileged group. Discrimination takes the form of more favorable predictions or higher accuracy for a privileged group. For example, some popular commercial gender classifiers were found to perform the worst on darker females (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018). From now on, such unfair and harmful decisions towards people with specific sensitive attributes will be called biased.\nThe list of protected attributes may depend on the region and domain for which the model is built. For example, the European Union law is summarized in the Handbook on European non-discrimination law European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and Council of Europe (2018), which lists the following protected attributes that cannot be the basis for inferior treatment: sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, nationality or national origin, religion or belief, social origin, birth, and property, language, political or other opinions. This list, though long, does not include all potentially relevant items, e.g. in the USA, a protected attribute is also pregnancy, the status of a war veteran, or genetic information.\nWhile there are historical and economic reasons for this to happen, such decisions are unacceptable in society, where nobody should have an unfair advantage.\nThe problem is not simple, especially when the only criterion set for the system is performance. We observe a trade-off between accuracy and fairness in some cases where lower discrimination leads to lower performance (Kamiran and Calders 2011). Sometimes labels, which are considered ground truth, might also be biased (Wick et al. 2019), and when controlling for that bias, the performance and fairness might improve simultaneously. However fairness is not a concept that a single number can summarize, so most of the time, when we want to improve fairness from one perspective, it becomes worse in another (Barocas et al. 2019).\nThe bias in machine learning systems has potentially many different sources. Mehrabi et al. (2019) categorized bias into its types like historical bias, where unfairness is already embedded into the data reflecting the world, observer bias, sampling bias, ranking and social biases, and many more. That shows how many dangers are potentially hidden in the data itself. Whether one would like to act on it or not, it is essential to detect bias and make well-informed decisions whose consequences could potentially harm many groups of people. Repercussions of such systems can be unpredictable. As argued by Barocas et al. (2019), machine learning systems can even aggravate the disparities between groups, which is called by the authors’ feedback loops. Sometimes the risk of potential harm resulting from the usage of such systems is high. This was noticed, for example, by the Council of Europe that wrote the set of guidelines where it states that the usage of facial recognition for the sake of determining a person’s sex, age, origin, or even emotions should be mostly prohibited (Council of Europe 2021).\nNot every difference in treatment is discrimination. Cirillo et al. (2020) presents examples of desirable and undesirable biases based on the medical domain. For example, in the case of cardiovascular diseases, documented medical knowledge indicates that different treatments are more effective for different genders. So different treatment regimens according to medical knowledge are examples of desirable bias. Later in this paper, we present tools to identify differences between groups defined by some protected attribute but note that this does not automatically mean that there is discrimination.\nWe would also like to point out that focusing on the machine learning model may not be enough in some cases, and sometimes the design of the data acquisition and/or annotation cause the model to be biased (Barocas et al. 2019).\nRelated work\nAssembling predictive models is getting easier nowadays. Packages like h2o (H2O.ai 2017) provide AutoML frameworks where non-experts can train quickly accurate models without deep domain knowledge. Model validation should also be that simple. Yet this is not the case. There are still very few tools to support the fairness diagnostics of the model.\nTwo main kinds of fairness are a concern to multiple stakeholders. These are group and individual fairness. The first one concerns groups of people with the same protected attributes (gender, race, etc.). It focuses on measuring if these groups are treated similarly by the model. The second one is focused on the individual. It is most intuitively defined as treating similar individuals similarly (Dwork et al. 2012). Both concepts are sometimes considered to conflict with each other, but they don’t need to be if we factor in certain assumptions, such as whether the disparities are due to personal choices or unjust structures (Binns 2020).\nSeveral frameworks have emerged for Python to verify various fairness criteria, the most popular are aif360 (Bellamy et al. 2018), fairlearn (Bird et al. 2020), or aequitas (Saleiro et al. 2018). They have various features for detecting, visualization, and mitigating bias in machine learning models.\nFor the R language, until recently, the only available tool was the fairness (Kozodoi and V. Varga 2021) package which compares various fairness metrics for specified subgroups. The fairness package is very helpful, but it lacks some features. For example, it does not allow comparing the machine learning models and aggregating fairness metrics to facilitate the visualization. Still, most of all, it does not give a quick verdict on whether a model is fair or not. Package fairadapt aims at removing bias from machine learning models by implementing pre-processing procedure described in Plečko and Meinshausen (2019). Our package tries to combine the detection and mitigation processes. It encourages the user to experiment with the bias, try different mitigation methods and compare results. The package fairmodels not only allows for that comparison between models and multiple exposed groups of people, but it gives direct feedback if the model is fair or not (more on that in the next section). Our package also equips the user with a so-called fairness_object, an object aggregating possibly many models, information about data, and fairness metrics. fairness_object can later be transformed into many other objects that can facilitate the visualization of metrics and models from different perspectives. If a model does not meet fairness criteria, various pre-processing and post-processing bias mitigation algorithms are implemented and ready to use. It aims to be a complete tool for dealing with discriminatory models in a group fairness setting.\nIn particular, in the following sections, we show how to use this package to address four key questions: How to measure bias? How to detect bias? How to visualize bias? and How to mitigate bias?\nIt is important to remember that fairness is not a binary concept that can be unambiguously defined, and there is no silver bullet that will make any model fair. The presented tools allow for fairness exploratory analysis, thanks to which we will be able to detect differences in the behavior of the model for different protected groups. But such analysis will not guarantee that all possible fairness problems have been detected. Also, fairness analysis is only one of a wide range of techniques for Explanatory Model Analysis (Biecek and Burzykowski 2021).\nLike other explanatory tools, it should be used with caution and awareness.\nMeasuring and detecting bias\nIn model fairness analysis, a distinction is often made between group fairness and individual fairness analysis. The former is defined by the equality of certain statistics determined on protected subgroups, and we focus on this approach in this section. We write more about the latter later in this paper.\nFairness metrics\nMachine learning models, just like human-based decisions, can be biased against observations related to people with certain sensitive attributes, which are also called protected groups. This is because they consist of subgroups - people who share the same sensitive attribute, like gender, race, or other features.\nTo address this problem, we need first to introduce fairness criteria. Following Barocas et al. (2019), we will present these criteria based on the following notation.\nLet \\(A \\in \\{a,b, ...\\}\\) mean protected group and values \\(A \\neq a\\) denote membership to unprivileged subgroups while \\(A = a\\) membership to privileged subgroup. To simplify the notation, we will treat this as a binary variable (so \\(A = b\\) will denote membership to unprivileged subgroup), but all results hold if \\(A\\) has a larger number of groups.\nLet \\(Y \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) be a binary label (binary target = binary classification) where \\(1\\) is preferred, favorable outcome.\nLet \\(R \\in [0,1]\\) be a probabilistic response of the model, and \\(\\hat{Y} \\in \\{0,1\\}\\) is the binarised model response, so \\(\\hat{Y} = 1\\) when \\(R \\geq 0.5\\), otherwise \\(\\hat{Y} = 0\\).\nFigure 1 summarizes possible situations for the subgroup \\(A=a\\). We can draw up the same table for each of the subgroups.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Summary of possible model outcomes for subpopulation \\(A = a\\). We assume that outcome \\(Y = 1\\) is favourable.\n\n\n\nAccording to Barocas et al. (2019) most discrimination criteria can be derived as tests that validate the following probabilistic definitions:\nIndependence, i.e. \\(R \\perp A\\),\nSeparation, i.e. \\(R \\perp A \\mid Y\\),\nSufficiency, i.e. \\(Y \\perp A \\mid R\\).\nThose criteria and their relaxations might be expressed via different metrics based on a confusion matrix for a certain subgroup. To check if those fairness criteria are addressed, we propose checking five metrics among privileged group (a) and unprivileged group (b):\nStatistical parity: \\(P(\\hat{Y} = 1 | A = a) = P(\\hat{Y} = 1 | A = b)\\). Statistical parity (STP) ensures that fractions of assigned positive labels are the same in subgroups. It is equivalent of Independence (Dwork et al. 2012). In other words, the values in the last column of Figure 1 are the same for each subgroup.\nEqual opportunity: \\(P(\\hat{Y} = 1 | A = a, Y = 1) = P(\\hat{Y} = 1 | A = b, Y = 1)\\). Checks if classifier has equal True Positive Rate (TPR) for each subgroup. In other words, the column normalized values in the second column of Figure 1 are the same for each subgroup. It is a relaxation of Separation (Hardt et al. 2016).\nPredictive parity: \\(P(Y = 1 | A = a, \\hat{Y} = 1) = P(Y = 1 | A = b, \\hat{Y} = 1)\\). Measures if a model has equal Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for each subgroup. In other words, the row normalized values in the second row of Figure 1 are the same for each subgroup. It is relaxation of Sufficiency (Chouldechova 2016).\nPredictive equality: \\(P(\\hat{Y} = 1 | A = a, Y = 0) = P(\\hat{Y} = 1 | A = b, Y = 0)\\). Warrants that classifiers have equal False Positive Rate (FPR) for each subgroup. In other words, the column normalized values in the third column of Figure 1 are the same for each subgroup. It is relaxation of Separation (Corbett-Davies et al. 2017).\n(Overall) Accuracy equality: \\(P(\\hat{Y} = Y | A = a) = P(\\hat{Y} = Y | A = b)\\). Makes sure that models have the same Accuracy (ACC) for each subgroup. (Berk et al. 2017)\nThe reader should note that if the classifier passes Equal opportunity and Predictive equality, it also passes Equalized Odds (Hardt et al. 2016), which is equivalent to Separation criteria.\nLet us illustrate the intuition behind Independence, Separation, and Sufficiency criteria using the well-known example of the COMPAS model for estimating recidivism risk.\nFulfilling the Independence criterion means that the rate of sentenced prisoners should be equal in each subpopulation. It can be said that such an approach is fair from society’s perspective.\nFulfilling the Separation criterion means that the fraction of innocents/guilty sentenced should be equal in subgroups. Such an approach is fair from the prisoner’s perspective. The reasoning is the following: “If I am innocent, I should have the same chance of acquittal regardless of sub-population”. This was the expectation presented by the ProPublica Foundation in their study.\nMeeting the Sufficiency criterion means that there should be an equal fraction of innocents among the convicted, similarly, for the non-convicted. This approach is fair from the judge’s perspective. The reasoning is the following: “If I convicted someone, he should have the same chance of being innocent regardless of the sub-population”. This approach is presented by the company developing the COMPAS model, Northpointe.\nUnfortunately, as we have already written, it is not possible to meet all these criteria at the same time.\nWhile defining the metrics above, we assumed only two subgroups. This was done to facilitate notation, but there might be more unprivileged subgroups. A perfectly fair model would pass all criteria for each subgroup (Barocas et al. 2019).\nNot all fairness metrics are equally important in all cases. The metrics above aim to give a more holistic view into the fairness of the machine learning model. Practitioners informed in the domain may consider only those metrics that are relevant and beneficial from their point of view. For example, in Kozodoi et al. (2021) in the fair credit scoring use case, the authors concluded that the separation is the most suitable non-discrimination criteria. More general instructions can also be found in European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (2018), along with examples of protected attributes. Sometimes, however, non-technical solutions to fairness problems might be beneficial. Note that group fairness metrics will discover not all types of unfairness, and the end-user should decide whether a model is acceptable in terms of bias or not.\nHowever tempting it is to think that all the criteria described above can be met at the same time, unfortunately, this is not possible. Barocas et al. (2019) shows that, apart from a few hypothetical situations, no two of {Independence, Separation, Sufficiency} can be fulfilled simultaneously. So we are left balancing between the degree of imbalance of the different criteria or deciding to control only one criterion.\nAcceptable amount of bias\nIt would be hard for any classifier to maintain the same relations between subgroups. That is why some margins around the perfect agreement are needed. To address this issue, we accepted the four-fifths rule (Code of Federal Regulations 1978) as the benchmark for discrimination rate, which states that “A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than four-fifths (\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\)) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact[…].” The selection rate is originally represented by statistical parity, but we adopted this rule to define acceptable rates between subgroups for all metrics. There are a few caveats to the preceding citation concerning the size of the sample and the boundary itself. Nevertheless, the four-fifths rule is an excellent guideline to adhere to. In the implementation, this boundary is represented by \\(\\varepsilon\\), and it is adjustable by the user, but the default value will be 0.8.\nThis rule is often used, but users should check if the fairness criteria should be set differently in each case.\nLet \\(\\varepsilon > 0\\) be the acceptable amount of a bias. In this article, we would say that the model is not discriminatory for a particular metric if the ratio between every unprivileged \\(b, c, ...\\) and privileged subgroup \\(a\\) is within \\((\\varepsilon, \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})\\). The common choice for the epsilon is 0.8, which corresponds to the four-fifths rule. For example, for the metric Statistical Parity (\\(STP\\)), a model would be \\(\\varepsilon\\)-non-discriminatory for privileged subgroup \\(a\\) if it satisfies.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\forall_{b \\in A \\setminus \\{a\\}} \\;\\;\n   \\varepsilon < STP_{ratio} = \\frac{STP_b}{STP_a} < \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}.\n  \\tag{1}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nEvaluating fairness\nThe main function in the fairmodels package is fairness_check. It returns fairness_object, which can be visualized or processed by other functions. This will be further explained in the “Structure” section. When calling fairness_check for the first time, the following three arguments are mandatory:\nexplainer - an object that combines model and data that gives a unified interface for predictions. It is a wrapper over a model created with the DALEX (Biecek 2018) package.\nprotected - a factor, vector containing sensitive attributes (protected group). It does not need to be binary. Instead, each level denotes a distinct subgroup. The most common examples are gender, race, nationality, etc.\nprivileged - a character/factor denoting a level in the protected vector which is suspected to be the most privileged one.\nExample\nIn the following example, we are using German Credit Data dataset (Dua and Graff 2017). In the dataset, there is information about people like age, sex, purpose, credit amount, etc. For each person, there is a risk assessed with taking credit, either good or bad. Therefore, it will be a target variable. We will train the model on the whole dataset and then measure fairness metrics to facilitate the notation (as opposed to training and testing on different subsets, which is also possible and advisable).\nFirst, we create a model. Let’s start with logistic regression.\n\n\nlibrary(\"fairmodels\")\ndata(\"german\")\n\nlm_model <- glm(Risk~., data = german, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\n\n\nThen, create a wrapper that unifies the model interface.\n\n\nlibrary(\"DALEX\")\n\ny_numeric <- as.numeric(german$Risk) -1\nexplainer_lm <- DALEX::explain(lm_model, data = german[,-1], y = y_numeric)\n\n\n\nNow we are ready to calculate and plot the fairness checks. Resulting plot is presented in Figure 2.\n\n\nfobject <- fairness_check(explainer_lm,\n                protected = german$Sex, privileged = \"male\",\n                verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(fobject)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The Fairness Check plot summarises the ratio of fairness measures between unprivileged and privileged subgroups. The light green areas correspond to values within \\((\\varepsilon, \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})\\) and signify an acceptable difference in fairness metrics. They are bounded by red rectangles indicating values that do not meet the 4/5 rule. Fairness metrics names are given along the formulas used to calculate the score in some subgroups to facilitate interpretation. For example, the ratio here means that after metric scores were calculated, the values for unprivileged groups (female) were divided by values for the privileged subgroup (male). In this example, except for the predictive equality ratio, the other measures are \\(\\varepsilon\\)-non-discriminatory.\n\n\n\nFor a quick assessment, if a model passes fairness criteria, the object created with fairness_check() might be summarized with the print() function. Total loss is the sum of all fairness metrics. See equation (2) for more details.\n\n\nprint(fobject, colorize = FALSE)\n\n\n\nFairness check for models: lm \n\nlm passes 4/5 metrics\nTotal loss :  0.6153324 \n\nIn this example, fairness criteria are satisfied in all but one metric. The logistic regression model has a lower false-positive rate (FP/(FP+TN))) in the unprivileged group than in the privileged group. It exceeds the acceptable limit set by \\(\\varepsilon\\). Thus it does not satisfy the Predictive Equality ratio criteria.\nMore detailed visualizations are available, like Metric scores plot. It might be helpful to understand the intuition behind the Fairness check plot presented above. See an example in Figure 3. This plot might be a good first point for understanding the Fairness check plot. In fact, checks can be directly derived from the Metric scores plot. To do this, we need to divide the score denoted by the dot with the score denoted by the vertical line. This way, we obtain a value indicated by the height of the barplot. The orientation of the barplot depends on whether the value is bigger or lower than 1. Intuitively the longer the horizontal line in the figure below (the one connecting the dot with the vertical line) is, the longer the bar will be in Fairness check plot. If the scores of privileged and unprivileged subgroups are the same, then the bar will start from 1 and point to 1, so it will have a height equal to 0.\n\n\nplot(metric_scores(fobject))\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The Metric Scores plot summarises raw fairness metrics scores for subgroups. The dots stand for unprivileged subgroups (female) while vertical lines stans for the privileged subgroup (male). The horizontal lines act as a visual aid for measuring the difference between the scores of the metrics between the privileged and unprivileged subgroups.\n\n\n\nIt is rare that a model perfectly meets all the fairness criteria. Therefore, a handy feature is the ability to compare several models on the same scale. We add two more explainers to the fairness assessment in the example below. Now fairness_object (in code: fobject) wraps three models together with different labels and cutoffs for subgroups. The fairness_object can be later used as a basis for another fairness_object. In detail, while running fairness_check() for the first time, explainer/explainers have to be provided along with three arguments described at the start of this section. However, as shown below, when providing explainers with a fairness_object, those arguments are not necessary as they are already a part of the previously created fairness_object.\nFirst, let us create two more models based on the German Credit Data. The first will be a logistic regression model that uses fewer columns and has access to the Sex feature. The second is random forest from ranger (Wright and Ziegler 2017). It will be trained on the whole dataset.\n\n\ndiscriminative_lm_model <- glm(Risk~.,\n         data   = german[c(\"Risk\", \"Sex\",\"Age\",\n                \"Checking.account\", \"Credit.amount\")],\n         family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nlibrary(\"ranger\")\nrf_model <- ranger::ranger(Risk ~.,\n         data = german, probability = TRUE,\n         max.depth = 4, seed = 123)\n\n\n\nThese models differ in the way how the predict function works. To unify operations on these models, we need to create DALEX explainer objects. The label argument specifies how these models are named on plots.\n\n\nexplainer_dlm <- DALEX::explain(discriminative_lm_model,\n        data = german[c(\"Sex\", \"Age\", \"Checking.account\", \"Credit.amount\")],\n        y = y_numeric,\n        label = \"discriminative_lm\") \n\nexplainer_rf <- DALEX::explain(rf_model, \n        data = german[,-1], y = y_numeric)\n\n\n\nNow we are ready to assess fairness. The resulting plot is presented in Figure 4.\n\n\nfobject <- fairness_check(explainer_rf, explainer_dlm, fobject)\nplot(fobject)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The Fairness Check plot for multiple models. It helps to compare models based on five selected fairness measures.\n\n\n\nWhen plotted, new bars appear on the fairness check plot. Those are new metric scores for added models. This information can be summarized in a numerical way with the print() function.\n\n\nprint(fobject, colorize = FALSE)\n\n\n\nFairness check for models: ranger, discriminative_lm, lm \n\nranger passes 5/5 metrics\nTotal loss :  0.1699186 \n\ndiscriminative_lm passes 3/5 metrics\nTotal loss :  0.7294678 \n\nlm passes 4/5 metrics\nTotal loss :  0.6153324 \n\nPackage architecture\nThe fairmodels package provides a unified interface for predictive models independently of their internal structure. Using a model agnostic approach with DALEX explainers facilitates this process (Biecek 2018). There is a unified way for each explainer to check if explained model lives up to user fairness standards. Checking fairness with fairmodels is straightforward and can be done with the three-step pipeline.\nclassification model   |>   explain()   |>   fairness_check() \nThe output of such a pipeline is an object of class fairness_object, a unified structure to wrap model explainer or multiple model explainers and other fairness_objects in a single container. Aggregation of fairness measures is done based on groups defined by model labels. This is why model explainers (even those wrapped by fairness_objects) must have different labels. Moreover, some visualizations for model comparison assume that all models are created from the same data. Of course, each model can use different variables or different feature transformations, but the order and number of rows shall stay the same. To facilitate aggregation of models fairmodels allows creating fairness_objects in other ways:\nexplainers |> fairness_check() - possibly many explainers can be passed to fairness_check(),\nfairness_objects |> fairness_check() - explainers stored in fairness_objects passed to fairness_check() will be aggregated into one fairness_object,\nexplainer & fairness_objects |> fairness_check() - explainers passed directly and explainers from fairness_objects will be aggregated into one fairness_object.\nWhen using the last two pipelines, protected vectors and privileged parameters are assumed to be the same, so passing them to fairness_check() is unnecessary.\nTo create a fairness_object, at least one explainer needs to be passed to fairness_check() function, which returns the said object. fairness_object metrics for each subgroup are calculated from the separate confusion matrices.\nThe fairness_object has numerous fields. Some of them are:\nparity_loss_metric_data - data.frame containing parity loss for each metric and classifier,\ngroups_data - list of metric scores for each metric and model,\ngroup_confusion_matrices - list of values in confusion matrices for each model and metric,\nexplainers - list of DALEX explainers. When explainers and/or fairness_object are added, then explainers and/or explainers extracted from fairness_object are added to that list,\nlabel - character vector of labels for each explainer.\n... - other fields.\nThe fairness_object methods are used to create numerous objects that help to visualize bias. In the next sections, we list more detailed functions for deeper exploration of bias. Detailed relations between objects created with fairmodels are depicted in Figure 5.\nThe general overview of the workflow is presented in Figure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Class diagram for objects created by functions from the fairmodels package. Each rectangle corresponds to one class, the name of this class is in the header of the rectangle. Each of these classes is a list containing a certain list of objects. The top slot lists the names and types of each object the list. The bottom slot contains a list of functions that can be performed on objects of the specified class. If two classes are connected by a line ending in a diamond it means that one class contains objects of the other class. If two rectangles are connected by a dashed line, it means that on the basis of one object, an object of another class can be produced. In this case, more detailed fairness statistics can be produced from the central object of the fairness check class. See the full resolution at https://bit.ly/3HNbNvo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Flowchart for the fairness assessment with the fairmodels package. The arrows describe typical sequences of actions when exploring the fairness of the models. For ease of use, the names of the functions that can be used in a given step are indicated. Note that this procedure is intended to look at the model from multiple perspectives in order to track down potential problems in the model. Merely satisfying the fairness criteria does not automatically mean that the model is free of any errors\n\n\n\nVisualizing bias\nIn fairmodels there are 12 metrics based on confusion matrices for each subgroup, see the following table for the complete list. Some of them were already introduced before.\n\n\nFairness metrics implemented in the fairmodels\npackage.\n\n\nMetric\n\n\nFormula\n\n\nName\n\n\nFairness criteria\n\n\nTPR\n\n\n\\(\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\\)\n\n\nTrue positive rate\n\n\nEqual opportunity (Hardt et al. 2016)\n\n\nTNR\n\n\n\\(\\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\\)\n\n\nTrue negative rate\n\n\n\n\nPPV\n\n\n\\(\\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\\)\n\n\nPositive predictive value\n\n\nPredictive parity (Chouldechova 2016)\n\n\nNPV\n\n\n\\(\\frac{TN}{TN + FN}\\)\n\n\nNegative predictive value\n\n\n\n\nFNR\n\n\n\\(\\frac{FN}{FN + TP}\\)\n\n\nFalse negative rate\n\n\n\n\nFPR\n\n\n\\(\\frac{FP}{FP + TN}\\)\n\n\nFalse positive rate\n\n\nPredictive equality (Corbett-Davies et al.\n2017)\n\n\nFDR\n\n\n\\(\\frac{FP}{FP + TP}\\)\n\n\nFalse discovery rate\n\n\n\n\nFOR\n\n\n\\(\\frac{FN}{FN + TN}\\)\n\n\nFalse omission rate\n\n\n\n\nTS\n\n\n\\(\\frac{TP}{TP + FN + FP}\\)\n\n\nThreat score\n\n\n\n\nF1\n\n\n\\(\\frac{2 \\cdot PPV * TPR}{PPV + TPR}\\)\n\n\nF1 score\n\n\n\n\nSTP\n\n\n\\(\\frac{TP + FP}{TP + FP + TN + FN}\\)\n\n\nPositive rate\n\n\nStatistical parity\n\n\nACC\n\n\n\\(\\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\\)\n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\nOverall accuracy equality\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all metrics are needed to determine if the discrimination exists, but they are helpful to acquire a fuller picture. To facilitate the visualization over many subgroups, we introduce a function that maps metric scores among subgroups to a single value. This function, which we call parity_loss, has an attractive property. Due to the usage of the absolute value of the natural logarithm, it will return the same value whether the ratio is inverted or not.\nSo, for example, when we would like to know the parity loss of Statistical Parity between unprivileged (b) and privileged (a) subgroups, we mean value like this:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nSTP_{\\textit{parity loss}} = \\Big | \\ln \\Big( \\frac{STP_b}{STP_a} \\Big)\\Big|.\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis notation is very helpful because it allows to accumulate \\(STP_{\\textit{parity loss}}\\) overall unprivileged subgroups, so not only in the binary case.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nSTP_{\\textit{parity loss}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\{a, b, ...\\}} \\Big|\\ln \\Big(\\frac{STP_i}{STP_a} \\Big)\\Big|.  \n  \\tag{2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe parity_loss relates strictly to ratios. The classifier is more fair if parity_loss is low. This property is helpful in visualizations.\nThere are several modifying functions that operate on fairness_object. Their usage will return other objects. The relations between them is depicted on the class diagram (Figure 5). The objects can then be plotted with a generic plot() function. Additionally, a special plotting function works immediately on fairness_object, which is plot_density. The user can directly specify which metrics shall be visible in the plot in some functions. The detailed technical introduction for all these functions is presented in fairmodels.\nPlots visualizing different aspects of parity_loss can be created with one of the following pipelines:\nfairness_object |> modifying_function(...) |> plot()\nThis pipe is preferred and allows setting parameters in both modifying functions and certain plot functions, which is not the case with the next pipeline.\nfairness_object |> plot_fairmodels(type = modifying_function, ...)\nAdditional parameters are passed to the modifying functions and not to the plot function.\nUsing the pipelines, different plots can be obtained by superseding the modifying_function with function names.\nFour examples of additional graphical functions available in the fairmodels can be seen in Figure 7. This package implements a total of 8 different diagnostic plots, each describing a different fairness perspective. To see different aspects of fairness and bias, the user can choose the model with the smallest bias, find out the similarity between metrics and models, compare models in both fairness and performance, and see how cutoff manipulation might change the parity_loss. Find more information about each of them in the documentation.\n\n\nfp1  <- plot(ceteris_paribus_cutoff(fobject, \"male\", cumulated=TRUE))\nfp2  <- plot(fairness_heatmap(fobject))\nfp3  <- plot(stack_metrics(fobject))\nfp4  <- plot(plot_density(fobject))\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(\"patchwork\")\nfp1 + fp2 + fp3 + fp4 + \n  plot_layout(ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Four examples of additional graphical functions are available in the fairmodels package that facilitates model and bias exploration. The Ceteris Paribus Cuttoff plot helps select the cutoff values for each model to maximize a particular measure of fairness. In this case, the suggested cutoff point for both linear models is similar. However, the ranger model does not have calibrated probabilities and thus requires a different cutoff. The Heatmap plot is very helpful when comparing large numbers of models. It shows profiles of selected fairness measures for each of the models under consideration. In this case, the fairness profiles for both linear models are similar. The Stacked Metric plot helps you compare models by summing five different fairness measures. The different layers of this plot allow you to compare individual measures, but if you don’t know which one to focus on, it is useful to look at the sum of the measures. In this case, the ranger model has the highest fairness values. Finally, the Density plot helps to compare the score distributions of the models between the advantaged and disadvantaged groups. In this case, we find that for females the distributions of the scores are lower in all models, with the largest difference for the lm model.\n\n\n\nBias mitigation\nWhat can be done if the model does not meet the fairness criteria? Machine learning practitioners might use other algorithms or variables to construct unbiased models, but this does not guarantee passing the fairness_check(). An alternative is to use bias mitigation techniques that adjust the data or model to meet fairness conditions.\nThere are essentially three types of such methods. The first is data pre-processing. There are many ways to “correct” the data when there are unwanted correlations between variables or sample sizes among subgroups in data. The second one is in-processing, which is, for example, optimizing classifiers not only to reduce classification error but also to minimize a fairness metric. Last but not least is post-processing which modifies model output so that predictions and miss-predictions among subgroups are more alike.\nThe fairmodels package offers five functions for bias mitigation, three for pre-processing, and two for post-processing. Most of these approaches are also implemented in (Bellamy et al. 2018). However, in fairmodels there are separate implementations of them in R. There are a lot of useful mitigation techniques that are not in fairmodels like those in Hardt et al. (2016) and numerous in-processing algorithms.\nData pre-processing\nDisparate impact remover\nIn fairmodels geometric repair, an algorithm originally introduced by Feldman et al. (2015), works on ordinal, numeric features. Depending on the \\(\\lambda \\in [0,1]\\) parameter, this method will transform the distribution of a given feature. The idea is simple. Given feature distribution in different subgroups, the algorithm finds optimal distribution (according to earth mover’s distance) and transforms distribution for each subgroup to match the optimal one. For example, if age is an important feature and its distribution is different in two subgroups, and we want to change that, then the geometric repair will map each individual’s age to a new distribution (different age). It will be preserving the order - the ranks (in our case, seniority) of observations are preserved. Parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is responsible for the repair degree, so for full repair, lambda should be set to 1. The method does not focus on a particular metric but rather tries to level out them by transforming potentially harmful feature distributions.\nReweighting\nReweighting is a rather straightforward approach. This method was implemented according to Kamiran and Calders (2011). It computes weights by dividing the theoretical probability of assigning favorable labels for a subgroup by real (observed) probability (based on the data). Theoretic probability for a subgroup is computed by multiplying the probability of assigning a favorable label (for all populations) by picking observation from a certain subgroup. It focuses on mitigating statistical parity.\nResampling\nResampling is based on weights calculated in reweighting. Each weight for a subgroup is multiplied by the size of the subgroup. Then, whether the subgroup is deprived or not (if weight is higher than one, the subgroup is considered deprived), observations are duplicated from either one that were assigned a favorable label or not. There are two types of resampling- uniform and preferential. The uniform is making algorithm pick or omit observations randomly without considering its probabilistic score. Preferential uses another probabilistic classifier, potentially different from the main model for final predictions. In Kamiran and Calders (2011) it is called ranker - it predicts the probabilities for the observations to decide which observations are close to the cutoff border (usually 0.5). Based on the probabilistic output of the ranker, the observations are sorted, and the ones with the highest/lowest ranks are either left out or duplicated depending on the case—more on that on Kamiran and Calders (2011). The fairmodels implementation, instead of training the ranker as in the aforementioned paper, uses a vector of previously calculated probabilities provided by the user. With this, it shifts the decision and responsibility of choosing a ranker to the user. It focuses on mitigating statistical parity.\nModel post-processing\nReject Option based Classification Pivot\nThe roc_pivot method is implemented based on Kamiran et al. (2012) in the fairmodels package. Let \\(\\theta \\in (0,1)\\) be the value that determines the radius of the so-called critical region, which is an area around the cutoff. The user specifies the \\(\\theta\\), and it should describe how big the critical region should be. For example if \\(\\theta = 0.1\\) and cutoff is 0.6, then the critical region will be (0.5, 0.7). Let’s assume that we are predicting a favorable outcome. If the assigned probability of observation is in the described region, then the probabilities are pivoting on the other side of the cutoff with a certain assumption. If an observation in a critical region is considered to be the privileged and it is on the right side of the cutoff, then its probabilities are pivoting from the right side of the cutoff to the left. So if an observation is in the critical region and it is considered unprivileged, then if it is on the left side of the cutoff, it will pivot to the right side. Pivoting here means changing the side of the cutoff so that the distance from the cutoff stays unchanged. It does not intend to mitigate a single metric but rather changes predictions in the critical region (the region with low certainty). By pivoting the predictions, it might lower more metrics.\nCutoff manipulation\nThe fairmodels package supports setting cutoff for each subgroup. Users may pick parity_loss metrics of their choice and find the minimal parity_loss. It is part of ceteris_paribus_cutoff() function. Based on picked metrics, the sum of parity loss is calculated for each cutoff of the chosen subgroup. Then the minimal value is found—this way, optimal values might be found for metrics of interest. The minimum is marked with a dashed vertical line (see Figure 7). This approach however might be to some extent concerning. Some might argue that setting different cutoffs for different subgroups is unfair and is punishing privileged subgroups for something they have no control of. Especially in the individual fairness field, it would be concerning if two similar people with different sensitive attributes would have two different thresholds and potentially two different outcomes. This is a valid point, and this method should be used with knowledge of all its drawbacks. The cutoff manipulation method targets metrics chosen by the user.\nAll pre-processing methods can be used with two pipelines, whereas post-processing can be used in one specific way.\nPre-processing pipelines\ndata/explainer |> method\nReturns either weights, indexes, or changed data depending on the method used.\ndata/explainer |> pre_process_data(data, protected, y, type = ...)\nAlways returns data.frame. In case of weights data has additional column called _weights_.\n\nPost-processing pipelines\nfairness_object |> ceteris_paribus_cutoff(subgroup, ...) |> print/plot\nThis is the pipeline for creating ceteris paribus cutoff print and plot.\nexplainer |> roc_pivot(protected, privileged, ...)\nThe pipeline will return explainer with y_hat field changed.\n\nThe user should be aware that debiasing one metric might enhance bias in another. It is a so-called fairness-fairness trade-off. There is also a fairness-performance trade-off where debiasing one metric leads to worse performance. Another thing to remember is, as found in Agrawal et al. (2020), metrics might not generalize well to out-of-distribution examples, so it is advised also to check the fairness metrics on a separate test set.\nExample\nNow we will show an example usage of one pre-processing and one post-processing method. As before, the German Credit Data will be used along with the previously created lm_model. So firstly, we create a new dataset using pre_process_data and then we use it to train the logistic regression classifier.\n\n\nresampled_german   <- german |> pre_process_data(protected = german$Sex,\n                y_numeric, type = 'resample_uniform')\n\nlm_model_resample  <- glm(Risk~.,\n                data   = resampled_german,\n                family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nexplainer_lm_resample <- DALEX::explain(lm_model_resample,\n                data = german[,-1], y = y_numeric, verbose = FALSE)\n\n\n\nThen we make other explainers. We use previously created explainer_lm with the post-processing function roc_pivot. We set parameter theta = 0.05 for a rather narrow area of a pivot.\n\n\nnew_explainer <- explainer_lm |> roc_pivot(protected = german$Sex,\n                privileged = \"male\", theta = 0.05)\n\n\n\nIn the end, we create fairness_object with explainers obtained with the code above and one created in the first example to see the difference.\n\n\nfobject <- fairness_check(explainer_lm_resample, new_explainer, explainer_lm,\n                protected = german$Sex, privileged = \"male\",\n                label = c(\"resample\", \"roc\", \"base\"),\n                verbose = FALSE)\n\nfobject |> plot()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Graphical summary of a base model (blue bars) and model after applying two bias mitigation techniques (red and green bars). By comparing adjacent rectangles one can read how the respective technique affected the corresponding fairness measure\n\n\n\nThe result of the code above is presented in Figure 8. The mitigation methods successfully eliminated bias in all of the metrics. Both models are better than the original base. This is not always the case - sometimes, eliminating bias in one metric may increase bias in another metric. For example, let’s consider a perfectly accurate model, but some subgroups receive few positive predictions (bias in Statistical parity). In that case, mitigating the bias in Statistical parity would decrease the Accuracy equality ratio.\nSummary and future work\nThis paper showed that checking for bias in machine learning models can be done conveniently and flexibly. The package fairmodels described above is a self-sufficient tool for bias detection, visualization, and mitigation in classification machine learning models. We presented theory, package architecture, suggested usage, and examples along with plots. Along the way, we introduced the core concepts and assumptions that come along the bias detection and plot interpretation. The package is still improved and enhanced, which can be seen by adding the announced regression module based on Steinberg et al. (2020). We did not cover it in this article because it is still an experimental tool. Another tool for in-processing classification closely related to fairmodels has also been added and can be found on https://github.com/ModelOriented/FairPAN.\nThe source code of the package, vignettes, examples, and documentation can be found at https://modeloriented.github.io/fairmodels/. The stable version is available on CRAN. The code and the development version can be found on GitHub https://github.com/ModelOriented/fairmodels. This is also a place to report bugs or requests (through GitHub issues).\nIn the future, we plan to enhance the spectrum of bias visualization plots and introduce regression and individual fairness methods. The potential way to explore would be an in-processing bias mitigation - training models that minimize cost function and adhere to certain fairness criteria. This field is heavily developed in Python and lacks appropriate attention in R.\nAcknowledgements\nWork on this package was financially supported by the NCN Sonata Bis-9 grant 2019/34/E/ST6/00052.\n\nSupplementary materials\nSupplementary materials are available in addition to this article.

    "description": "The flexibility of R and the diversity of the R community leads to a large number of programming styles applied in R packages. We have analyzed 108 million lines of R code from CRAN and quantified the evolution in popularity of 12 style-elements from 1998 to 2019. We attribute 3 main factors that drive changes in programming style: the effect of style-guides, the effect of introducing new features, and the effect of editors. We observe in the data that a consensus in programming style is forming, such as using lower snake case for function names (e.g. softplus_func) and \\<- rather than = for assignment.",

    "title": "A Software Tool For Sparse Estimation Of A General Class Of High-dimensional GLMs",
    "description": "Generalized linear models are the workhorse of many inferential problems. Also in the modern era with high-dimensional settings, such models have been proven to be effective exploratory tools. Most attention has been paid to Gaussian, binomial and Poisson settings, which have efficient computational implementations and where either the dispersion parameter is largely irrelevant or absent. However, general GLMs have dispersion parameters $\\phi$ that affect the value of the log-likelihood. This in turn, affects the value of various information criteria such as AIC and BIC, and has a considerable impact on the computation and selection of the optimal model. The R-package [dglars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dglars) is one of the standard packages to perform high-dimensional analyses for GLMs. Being based on fundamental likelihood considerations, rather than arbitrary penalization, it naturally extends to the general GLM setting. In this paper, we present an improved predictor-corrector (IPC) algorithm for computing the differential geometric least angle regression (dgLARS) solution curve, proposed in [@Augug13] and [@pazira]. We describe the implementation of a stable estimator of the dispersion parameter proposed in [@pazira] for high-dimensional exponential dispersion models. A simulation study is conducted to test the performance of the proposed methods and algorithms. We illustrate the methods using an example. The described improvements have been implemented in a new version of the R-package [dglars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dglars).",

    "description": "This paper introduces the R package [bayesanova](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bayesanova), which performs Bayesian inference in the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Traditional ANOVA based on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is prone to overestimating effects and stating effects if none are present. Bayesian ANOVAs developed so far are based on Bayes factors (BF), which also enforce a hypothesis testing stance. Instead, the Bayesian ANOVA implemented in bayesanova focusses on effect size estimation and is based on a Gaussian mixture with known allocations, for which full posterior inference for the component parameters is implemented via Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Inference for the difference in means, standard deviations and effect sizes between each of the groups is obtained automatically. Estimation of the parameters instead of hypothesis testing is embraced via the region of practical equivalence (ROPE), and helper functions provide checks of the model assumptions and visualization of the results.",

    "description": "In this paper, we propose an R package, called [RKHSMetaMod](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RKHSMetaMod), that implements a procedure for estimating a meta-model of a complex model. The meta-model approximates the Hoeffding decomposition of the complex model and allows us to perform sensitivity analysis on it. It belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space that is constructed as a direct sum of Hilbert spaces. The estimator of the meta-model is the solution of a penalized empirical least-squares minimization with the sum of the Hilbert norm and the empirical $L^2$-norm. This procedure, called RKHS ridge group sparse, allows both to select and estimate the terms in the Hoeffding decomposition, and therefore, to select and estimate the Sobol indices that are non-zero. The [RKHSMetaMod](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RKHSMetaMod) package provides an interface from the R statistical computing environment to the C++ libraries Eigen and GSL. In order to speed up the execution time and optimize the storage memory, except for a function that is written in R, all of the functions of this package are written using the efficient C++ libraries through [RcppEigen](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppEigen) and [RcppGSL](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppGSL) packages. These functions are then interfaced in the R environment in order to propose a user-friendly package.",

    "description": "Urban shrinking is a phenomenon as common as urban expansion nowadays and it affects urban settlements of all sizes, especially from developed and industrialized countries in Europe, America and Asia. The paper aims to assess the patterns of shrinkage for small and medium sized towns in Oltenia region (Romania), considering demographic, economic and social indicators with a methodological approach which considers the use of different functions and applications of R packages. Thirteen selected indicators are analysed to perform the multivariate analysis on Principal Component Analysis using the prcomp() function and the [ggplot2](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) package to visualize the patterns of urban shrinkage. Two composite indicators were additionally created to measure the extent of urban shrinkage: CSI (Composite Shrinking Index) and RDC (Regional Demographic Change) for two-time intervals. Based on the CSI, three major categories of shrinking were observed: persistent shrinkage, mild shrinking or slow evolution toward shrinking, where the vast majority of towns are found (including mining towns, where there still is a delayed restructuring of state-owned enterprises, and towns characterised by the agrarization of local economies), and stagnant/stabilized shrinkage.",

When the uncertainty about the magnitude of these parameters is high, an internal pilot study design with a blinded sample size recalculation can be used to achieve the target power even when the initially assumed value for the nuisance parameter is wrong. In this paper, we present the R-package blindrecalc that helps with planning a clinical trial with such a design by computing the operating characteristics and the distribution of the total sample size under different true values of the nuisance parameter.

In general, there are many alternative approaches to nonlinearity modelling, one consists in assuming multiple regimes. Among the possible specifications that account for regime changes in the multivariate framework, smooth transition models are the most general, since they nest both linear and threshold autoregressive models. This paper introduces the [starvars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=starvars) package which estimates and predicts the Vector Logistic Smooth Transition model in a very general setting which also includes predetermined variables. In comparison to the existing R packages, starvars offers the estimation of the Vector Smooth Transition model both by maximum likelihood and nonlinear least squares. The package allows also to test for nonlinearity in a multivariate setting and detect the presence of common breaks. Furthermore, the package computes multi-step-ahead forecasts. Finally, an illustration with financial time series is provided to show its usage.",

    "title": "Palmer Archipelago Penguins Data in the palmerpenguins R Package - An Alternative to Anderson's Irises",
    "description": "In 1935, Edgar Anderson collected size measurements for 150 flowers from three species of *Iris* on the Gaspé Peninsula in Quebec, Canada. Since then, Anderson's *Iris* observations have become a classic dataset in statistics, machine learning, and data science teaching materials. It is included in the base R datasets package as `iris`, making it easy for users to access without knowing much about it. However, the lack of data documentation, presence of non-intuitive variables (e.g. \"sepal width\"), and perfectly balanced groups with zero missing values make `iris` an inadequate and stale dataset for teaching and learning modern data science skills. Users would benefit from working with a more representative, real-world environmental dataset with a clear link to current scientific research. Importantly, Anderson’s *Iris* data appeared in a 1936 publication by R. A. Fisher in the *Annals of Eugenics* (which is often the first-listed citation for the dataset), inextricably linking `iris` to eugenics research. Thus, a modern alternative to `iris` is needed. In this paper, we introduce the palmerpenguins R package [@R-palmerpenguins], which includes body size measurements collected from 2007 - 2009 for three species of *Pygoscelis* penguins that breed on islands throughout the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The `penguins` dataset in palmerpenguins provides an approachable, charismatic, and near drop-in replacement for `iris` with topical relevance for polar climate change and environmental impacts on marine predators. Since the release on CRAN in July 2020, the palmerpenguins package has been downloaded over 462,000 times, highlighting the demand and widespread adoption of this viable `iris` alternative.  We directly compare the `iris` and `penguins` datasets for selected analyses to demonstrate that R users, in particular teachers and learners currently using `iris`, can switch to the Palmer Archipelago penguins for many use cases including data wrangling, visualization, linear modeling, multivariate analysis (e.g., PCA), cluster analysis and classification (e.g., by k-means).",

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1935, American botanist Edgar Anderson measured petal and sepal structural dimensions (length and width) for 50 flowers from three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica (Anderson 1935). The manageable but non-trivial size (5 variables and 150 total observations) and characteristics of Anderson’s Iris dataset, including linear relationships and multivariate normality, have made it amenable for introducing a wide range of statistical methods including data wrangling, visualization, linear modeling, multivariate analyses, and machine learning. The Iris dataset is built into a number of software packages including the auto-installed datasets package in R (as iris, R Core Team 2021), Python’s scikit-learn machine learning library (Pedregosa et al. 2011), and the SAS Sashelp library (SAS Institute, Cary NC), which has facilitated its widespread use. As a result, eighty-six years after the data were initially published, the Iris dataset remains ubiquitous in statistics, computational methods, software documentation, and data science courses and materials.\nThere are a number of reasons that modern data science practitioners and educators may want to move on from iris. First, the dataset lacks metadata (Anderson 1935), which does not reinforce best practices and limits meaningful interpretation and discussion of research methods, analyses, and outcomes. Of the five variables in iris, two (Sepal.Width and Sepal.Length) are not intuitive for most non-botanists. Even with explanation, the difference between petal and sepal dimensions is not obvious. Second, iris contains equal sample sizes for each of the three species (n = 50) with no missing values, which is cleaner than most real-world data that learners are likely to encounter. Third, the single factor (Species) in iris limits options for analyses. Finally, due to its publication in the Annals of Eugenics by statistician R.A. Fisher (Fisher 1936), iris is burdened by a history in eugenics research, which we are committed to addressing through the development of new data science education products as described below.\nGiven the growing need for fresh data science-ready datasets, we sought to identify an alternative dataset that could be made easily accessible for a broad audience. After evaluating the positive and negative features of iris in data science and statistics materials, we established the following criteria for a suitable alternative:\nAvailable by appropriate license like a Creative Commons 0 license (CC0 “no rights reserved”)\nFeature intuitive subjects and variables that are interesting and understandable to learners across disciplines\nComplete metadata and documentation\nManageable (but not trivial) in size\nMinimal data cleaning and pre-processing required for most analyses\nReal-world (not manufactured) modern data\nProvides similar opportunities for teaching and learning R, data science, and statistical skills\nCan easily replace iris for most use cases\nHere, we describe an alternative to iris that largely satisfies these criteria: a refreshing, approachable, and charismatic dataset containing real-world body size measurements for three Pygoscelis penguin species that breed throughout the Western Antarctic Peninsula region, made available through the United States Long-Term Ecological Research (US LTER) Network. By comparing data structure, size, and a range of analyses side-by-side for the two datasets, we demonstrate that the Palmer Archipelago penguin data are an ideal substitute for iris for many use cases in statistics and data science education.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The palmerpenguins package hex sticker designed by Allison Horst\n\n\n\nData source\nBody size measurements (bill length and depth, flipper length - flippers are the modified “wings” of penguins used for maneuvering in water, and body mass), clutch (i.e., egg laying) observations (e.g., date of first egg laid, and clutch completion), and carbon (13C/12C, \\(\\delta\\)13C) and nitrogen (15N/14N, \\(\\delta\\)15N) stable isotope values of red blood cells for adult male and female Adélie (P. adeliae), chinstrap (P. antarcticus), and gentoo (P. papua) penguins on three islands (Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen) within the Palmer Archipelago were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman in collaboration with the Palmer Station LTER, part of the US LTER Network. For complete data collection methods and published analyses, see Gorman et al. (2014). Throughout this paper, penguins species are referred to as “Adélie”, “Chinstrap”, and “Gentoo”.\nThe data in the palmerpenguins R package are available for use by CC0 license (“No Rights Reserved”) in accordance with the Palmer Station LTER Data Policy and the LTER Data Access Policy, and were imported from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Data Portal at the links below:\nAdélie penguin data (Palmer Station Antarctica LTER and Gorman 2020a): KNB-LTER Data Package 219.5\nGentoo penguin data (Palmer Station Antarctica LTER and Gorman 2020c): KNB-LTER Data Package 220.5\nChinstrap penguin data (Palmer Station Antarctica LTER and Gorman 2020b): KNB-LTER Data Package 221.6\nThe palmerpenguins R package\nR users can install the palmerpenguins package from CRAN:\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\nInformation, examples, and links to community-contributed materials are available on the palmerpenguins package website: allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/. See the Appendix for how Python and Julia users can access the same data.\nThe palmerpenguins R package contains two data objects: penguins_raw and penguins. The penguins_raw data consists of all raw data for 17 variables, recorded completely or in part for 344 individual penguins, accessed directly from EDI (penguins_raw properties are summarized in Appendix B). We generally recommend using the curated data in penguins, which is a subset of penguins_raw retaining all 344 observations, minimally updated (Appendix A) and reduced to the following eight variables:\nspecies: a factor denoting the penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo)\nisland: a factor denoting the Palmer Archipelago island in Antarctica where each penguin was observed (Biscoe Point, Dream Island, or Torgersen Island)\nbill_length_mm: a number denoting length of the dorsal ridge of a penguin bill (millimeters)\nbill_depth_mm: a number denoting the depth of a penguin bill (millimeters)\nflipper_length_mm: an integer denoting the length of a penguin flipper (millimeters)\nbody_mass_g: an integer denoting the weight of a penguin’s body (grams)\nsex: a factor denoting the sex of a penguin sex (male, female) based on molecular data\nyear: an integer denoting the year of study (2007, 2008, or 2009)\nThe same data exist as comma-separated value (CSV) files in the package (“penguins_raw.csv” and “penguins.csv”), and can be read in using the built-in path_to_file() function in palmerpenguins. For example,\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\ndf <- read.csv(path_to_file(\"penguins.csv\"))\nwill read in “penguins.csv” as if from an external file, thus automatically parsing species, island, and sex variables as characters instead of factors. This option allows users opportunities to practice or demonstrate reading in data from a CSV, then updating variable class (e.g., characters to factors).\nComparing iris and penguins\nThe penguins data in palmerpenguins is useful and approachable for data science and statistics education, and is uniquely well-suited to replace the iris dataset. Comparisons presented are selected examples for common iris uses, and are not exhaustive.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Overview comparison of penguins and iris dataset features and characteristics.\n\n\nFeature\n\n\niris\n\n\npenguins\n\n\nYear(s) collected\n\n\n1935\n\n\n2007 - 2009\n\n\nDimensions (col x row)\n\n\n5 x 150\n\n\n8 x 344\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nminimal\n\n\ncomplete metadata\n\n\nVariable classes\n\n\ndouble (4), factor (1)\n\n\ndouble (2), int (3), factor (3)\n\n\nMissing values?\n\n\nno (n = 0; 0.0%)\n\n\nyes (n = 19; 0.7%)\n\n\n\n\n\nData structure and sample size\nBoth iris and penguins are in tidy format (Wickham 2014) with each column denoting a single variable and each row containing measurements for a single iris flower or penguin, respectively. The two datasets are comparable in size: dimensions (columns × rows) are 5 × 150 and 8 × 344 for iris and penguins, respectively, and sample sizes within species are similar (Tables 1 & 2).\nNotably, while sample sizes in iris across species are all the same, sample sizes in penguins differ across the three species. The inclusion of three factor variables in penguins (species, island, and sex), along with year, create additional opportunities for grouping, faceting, and analysis compared to the single factor (Species) in iris.\nUnlike iris, which contains only complete cases, the penguins dataset contains a small number of missing values (nmissing = 19, out of 2,752 total values). Missing values and unequal sample sizes are common in real-world data, and create added learning opportunity to the penguins dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Grouped sample size for iris (by species; n = 150 total) and penguins (by species and sex; n = 344 total).

Significance indicated for bivariate correlations: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distributions and correlations for numeric variables in iris (petal length (cm), petal width (cm), sepal length (cm) and sepal width (cm)) for the three included iris species: Iris setosa (light gray, circles); Iris versicolor (dark gray, triangles); and Iris virginica (black, squares). Significance indicated for bivariate correlations: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.\n\n\n\nBoth penguins and iris offer numerous opportunities to explore linear relationships and correlations, within and across species (Figures 2 & 3). A bivariate scatterplot made with the iris dataset reveals a clear linear relationship between petal length and petal width. Using penguins (Figure 4), we can create a uniquely similar scatterplot with flipper length and body mass. The overall trend across all three species is approximately linear for both iris and penguins. Teachers may encourage students to explore how simple linear regression results and predictions differ when the species variable is omitted, compared to, for example, multiple linear regression with species included (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Representative linear relationships for (A): penguin flipper length (mm) and body mass (g) for Adélie (orange circles), Chinstrap (blue triangles), and Gentoo (green squares) penguins; (B): iris petal length (cm) and width (cm) for Iris setosa (light gray circles), Iris versicolor (dark gray triangles) and Iris virginica (black squares). Within-species linear model is visualized for each penguin or iris species.\n\n\n\nNotably, distinctions between species are clearer for iris petals - particularly, the much smaller petals for Iris setosa - compared to penguins, in which Adélie and Chinstrap penguins are largely overlapping in body size (body mass and flipper length), and are both generally smaller than Gentoo penguins.\nSimpson’s Paradox is a data phenomenon in which a trend observed between variables is reversed when data are pooled, omitting a meaningful variable. While often taught and discussed in statistics courses, finding a real-world and approachable example of Simpson’s Paradox can be a challenge. Here, we show one (of several possible - see Figure 2) Simpson’s Paradox example in penguins: exploring bill dimensions with and without species included (Figure 5). When penguin species is omitted (Figure 5A), bill length and depth appear negatively correlated overall. The trend is reversed when species is included, revealing an obviously positive correlation between bill length and bill depth within species (Figure 5B).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Trends for penguin bill dimensions (bill length and bill depth, millimeters) if the species variable is excluded (A) or included (B), illustrating Simpson’s Paradox. Note: linear regression for bill dimensions without including species in (A) is ill-advised; the linear trendline is only included to visualize trend reversal for Simpson’s Paradox when compared to (B).\n\n\n\nPrincipal component analysis\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensional reduction method commonly used to explore patterns in multivariate data. The iris dataset frequently appears in PCA tutorials due to multivariate normality and clear interpretation of variable loadings and clustering.\nA comparison of PCA with the four variables of structural size measurements in penguins and iris (both normalized prior to PCA) reveals highly similar results (Figure 6). For both datasets, one species is distinct (Gentoo penguins, and setosa irises) while the other two species (Chinstrap/Adélie and versicolor/virginica) appear somewhat overlapping in the first two principal components (Figure 6 A,B). Screeplots reveal that the variance explained by each principal component (PC) is very similar across the two datasets, particularly for PC1 and PC2: for penguins, 88.15% of total variance is captured by the first two PCs, compared to 95.81% for iris, with a similarly large percentage of variance captured by PC1 and PC2 in each (Figure 6 C,D).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Principal component analysis biplots and screeplots for structural size measurements in penguins (A,C) and iris (B,D), revealing similarities in multivariate patterns, variable loadings, and variance explained by each component. For penguins, variables are flipper length (mm), body mass (g), bill length (mm) and bill depth (mm); groups are visualized by species (Adélie = orange circles, Chinstrap = blue triangles, Gentoo = green squares). For iris, variables are petal length (cm), petal width (cm), sepal length (cm) and sepal width (cm); groups are visualized by species (Iris setosa = light gray circles, Iris versicolor = dark gray triangles, Iris virginica = black squares). Values above screeplot columns (C,D) indicate percent of total variance explained by each of the four principal components.\n\n\n\nK-means clustering\nUnsupervised clustering by k-means is a common and popular entryway to machine learning and classification, and again, the iris dataset is frequently used in introductory examples. The penguins data provides similar opportunities for introducing k-means clustering. For simplicity, we compare k-means clustering using only two variables for each dataset: for iris, petal width and petal length, and for penguins, bill length and bill depth. All variables are scaled prior to k-means. Three clusters (k = 3) are specified for each, since there are three species of irises (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica) and penguins (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo).\nK-means clustering with penguin bill dimensions and iris petal dimensions yields largely distinct clusters, each dominated by one species (Figure 7). For iris petal dimensions, k-means yields a perfectly separated cluster (Cluster 3) containing all 50 Iris setosa observations and zero misclassified Iris virginica or Iris versicolor (Table 3). While clustering is not perfectly distinct for any penguin species, each species is largely contained within a single cluster, with little overlap from the other two species. For example, considering Adélie penguins (orange observations in Figure 7A): 147 (out of 151) Adélie penguins are assigned to Cluster 3, zero are assigned to Cluster 1, and 4 are assigned to the Chinstrap-dominated Cluster 2 (Table 3). Only 5 (of 68) Chinstrap penguins and 1 (of 123) Gentoo penguins are assigned to the Adélie-dominated Cluster 3 (Table 3).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: K-means clustering outcomes for penguin bill dimensions (A) and iris petal dimensions (B). Numbers indicate the cluster to which an observation was assigned, revealing a high degree of separation between species for both penguins and iris. Penguin species (Adélie = orange, Chinstrap = blue, Gentoo = green) and iris species (setosa = light gray, versicolor = medium gray, virginica = dark gray), along with bill dimensions and cluster number, are included in the tooltip when hovering.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: K-means cluster assignments by species based on penguin bill length (mm) and depth (mm), and iris petal length (cm) and width (cm).\n\n\n\nPenguins cluster assignments\n\n\n\n\nIris cluster assignments\n\n\n\nCluster\n\n\nAdélie\n\n\nChinstrap\n\n\nGentoo\n\n\nCluster\n\n\nsetosa\n\n\nversicolor\n\n\nvirginica\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n9\n\n\n116\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n2\n\n\n46\n\n\n2\n\n\n4\n\n\n54\n\n\n6\n\n\n2\n\n\n0\n\n\n48\n\n\n4\n\n\n3\n\n\n147\n\n\n5\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n50\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\nConclusion\nHere, we have shown that structural size measurements for Palmer Archipelago Pygoscelis penguins, available as penguins in the palmerpenguins R package, offer a near drop-in replacement for iris in a number of common use cases for data science and statistics education including exploratory data visualization, linear correlation and regression, PCA, and clustering by k-means. In addition, teaching and learning opportunities in penguins are increased due to a greater number of variables, missing values, unequal sample sizes, and Simpson’s Paradox examples. Importantly, the penguins dataset encompasses real-world information derived from several charismatic marine predator species with regional breeding populations notably responding to environmental change occurring throughout the Western Antarctic Peninsula region of the Southern Ocean (see Bestelmeyer et al. (2011), Gorman et al. (2014), Gorman et al. (2017), Gorman et al. (2021)). Thus, the penguins dataset can facilitate discussions more broadly on biodiversity responses to global change - a contemporary and critical topic in ecology, evolution, and the environmental sciences.\nPenguins data processing\nData in the penguins object have been minimally updated from penguins_raw as follows:\nAll variable names are converted to lower snake case (e.g. from Flipper Length (mm) to flipper_length_mm)\nEntries in species are truncated to only include the common name (e.g. “Gentoo”, instead of “gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)”)\nRecorded sex for penguin N36A1, originally recorded as “.”, is updated to NA\nculmen_length_mm and culmen_depth_mm variable names are updated to bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm, respectively\nClass for categorical variables (species, island, sex) is updated to factor\nVariable year was pulled from clutch observations\nSummary of the penguins_raw dataset\n\n\nFeature\n\n\npenguins_raw\n\n\nYear(s) collected\n\n\n2007 - 2009\n\n\nDimensions (col x row)\n\n\n17 x 344\n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\ncomplete metadata\n\n\nVariable classes\n\n\ncharacter (9), Date (1), numeric (7)\n\n\nMissing values?\n\n\nyes (n = 336; 5.7%)\n\n\npalmerpenguins for other programming languages\nPython: Python users can load the palmerpenguins datasets into their Python environment using the following code to install and access data in the palmerpenguins Python package:\npip install palmerpenguins\nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\npenguins = load_penguins()\nJulia: Julia users can access the penguins data in the PalmerPenguins.jl package.

    "description": "Various R packages and best practices have played a pivotal role to promote the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse (FAIR) principles of open science. For example, (1) well-documented R scripts and notebooks with rich narratives are deposited at a trusted data centre, (2) R Markdown interactive notebooks can be run on-demand as a web service, and (3) R Shiny web apps provide nice user interfaces to explore research outputs. However, notebooks require users to go through the entire analysis, while Shiny apps do not expose the underlying code and require extra work for UI design. We propose using the learnr package to expose certain code chunks in R Markdown so that users can readily experiment with them in guided, editable, isolated, executable, and resettable code sandboxes. Our approach does not replace the existing use of notebooks and Shiny apps, but it adds another level of abstraction between them to promote reproducible science.",

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nThere has been considerable recognition of the need to promote open and reproducible science in the past decade. The FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016; Stall et al. 2019) (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) of reproducible research are now known to most scientists. While significant advances has been made through the adoption of various best practices and policies (e.g. requirements from funders and publishers to archive data and source code, metadata standards), there remains considerable barriers to further advance open science and meet reproducible science needs. One of such issues the availability of various levels of abstraction of the same underlying analysis and code base to collaborate and engage with different stakeholders of diverse needs (Blair et al. 2019; Hollaway et al. 2020). For complex analysis or analysis that utilize a more advanced computing environment, it is essential to provide the capability to allow users to interact with the analysis at a higher level.\nExisting approach to reproducible research focuses on either documenting an entire analysis or allows user-friendly interaction. Within the R ecosystem, R scripts and notebooks allow researchers to work together and to view the entire workflow, while R Shiny apps (Chang et al. 2019) allows rapid showcase of methods and research outcomes to users with less experience. R Shiny has been widely adopted to share research output and engage stakeholders since its conception in 2013. A recent review (Kasprzak et al. 2021) shows that bioinformatics is the subject with the most Shiny apps published in journals while earth and environmental science ranks second. Shiny apps are especially helpful to create reproducible analysis (e.g. examples in Hollaway et al. 2020) and explore different scenarios (e.g. Whateley et al. 2015; Mose et al. 2018). Finally, the interactivity of Shiny apps makes it an excellent tool for teaching (e.g. Williams and Williams 2017; Field 2020). However, not all users fit nicely into this dichotomy. Some users may only want to adopt a small fraction of an analysis for their work, while others may simply want to modify a few parts of the analysis in order to test alternative hypothesis. Current use of notebooks do not seem to support such diverse needs as notebook output (e.g. figures and tables) are not easily reproducible. This issue essentially applies to all coding languages.\nOne potential way to address the problem described above is to allow\nusers to experiment with the code in protected computing environment.\nThis is not limited to creating instances for users to re-run the entire\ncode. Rather, this can also be done by exposing specific parts of a\nnotebook as editable and executable code boxes, as seen in many\ninteractive tutorial web pages for various coding languages. Recently,\nwhile discussing next steps for fostering reproducible research in\nartificial intelligence, Carter et al. (2019) lists creating a protected\ncomputing environment (‘data enclave’ or ‘sandbox’) for reviewers to log\nin and explore as one of the solutions. In software engineering, a\nsandbox is a testing environment that isolates untested code changes and\noutright experimentation from the production environment or repository,\nin the context of software development including Web development and\nrevision control. Making a sandbox environment available for users to\ntest and explore various changes to the code that leads to research\noutputs is a great step to further open science. Current practice of\nopen science largely requires users to assemble the notebooks, scripts\nand data files provided in their own computing environment, which\nrequires significant amount of time and effort. A sandbox environment\ncan greatly reduce such barriers and if such sandboxes are available as\na web service, users can explore and interact with the code that\ngenerates the research outputs at the convenience of their own web browser\non demand.\nIn this paper, we describe a rapid approach to create and publish\n‘interactive sandboxes’ R Shiny apps from R Markdown documents using\nthe learnr package, with the aim to bridge the gap between\ntypical R Markdown notebook and typical Shiny apps in terms of levels of\nabstraction. While code and markdown documents gives full details of the\ncode, standard R Shiny apps has too much limitations on users to\ninteract with the code and users often cannot see the underlying code.\nOur approach allows users to interact with selected parts of the code in\nan isolated manner, by specifying certain code chunks in a R Markdown\ndocument as executable code boxes.\nThe learnr R package\nlearnr (Schloerke et al. 2020) is an R package developed by RStudio to\nrapidly create interactive tutorials. It follows the general (the file has .Rmd extensions,\nhttps://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html) architecture and\nessentially creates a pre-rendered Shiny document similar to the way\nShiny user interface (UI) components can be added to any R Markdown documents.\nPre-rendered Shiny documents\n(https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny_prerendered.HTML)\nis a key enabling technology for the learnr package since it\nallows users to specify the execution context in each code chunk of a R\nMarkdown document that is used to render a R Shiny web app. Its use\ncircumvents the need of a full document render for each end user browser\nsession so that this type of R Shiny apps can load quickly. To create a\nlearnr tutorial in RStudio after learnr is\ninstalled, the user chooses a learnr R Markdown template from\na list after clicking the “create new R Markdown document” button. This\ntemplate is not different from other .Rmd files, except it requires\nadditional chunk arguments to control the sandbox appearances. The two\nmain features of the learnr package are the “exercise” and\n“quiz” options. The former allows users to directly type in code,\nexecute it, and see its results to test their knowledge while the latter\nallows other question types such as multiple choice. Both of these\noptions include auto-graders, hints, and instructor feedback options.\nAdditional overall options include setting time limits and an option to\nforbid users to skip sections. Like any Shiny apps, learnr\napps can be easily embedded to other web pages, as seen in Higgins (2021).\nAlthough the learnr package has existed for a few years now,\nit is relatively not well known to scientists as a potential use of R\nShiny Apps and it has mostly been used for simple tutorial apps designed\nfor R beginners. We propose a novel application of the learnr\npackage to advance reproducible research, which we outline in the next\nsection.\nApproach: Using learnr for reproducible research ‘sandboxes’\nlearnr allows users to create executable code boxes. Our\napproach is to publish R notebooks and serve parts of the notebooks as\ninteractive sandboxes to allow users to re-create certain elements of a\npublished notebook containing research outputs. We do not use the\nauto-graders or any quiz-like functionality of learnr while\nkeeping the sandboxes. Notebook authors can go through their notebook\nand select the code chunks that they would allow users to experiment,\nwhile the others are rendered as static code snippets.\nRecognizing learnr documents are themselves R Shiny web apps,\nour approach essentially allows the publication of notebooks in the form\nof web apps. However, unlike a typical R Shiny web app, users do not\nneed to prepare a separate UI (i.e. user interface) layout. Advanced\nusers can modify the site appearance by supplying custom design in .css\nfiles.\nHere, we first show the skeleton of a R Markdown (.Rmd) file for a\nlearnr document (Figure 1). Notice that it is very similar to\na typical .Rmd file where there is a mixture of narratives written in\nmarkdown and R code chunks, in addition to a YAML header. However,\nthere are a couple of important exceptions, namely the use of the\n“exercise” chunk option (i.e. editable and executable code boxes)\nand different output type in the YAML header.\nNext, we outline the steps an author needs to take to publish notebooks (i.e. R Markdown documents) as interactive sandboxes:\nAll research output is included in the form of a well-documented R Markdown document.\nOpen a new learnr R Markdown template. Copy the content of the original notebook.\nFor the code chunks that you would like to become sandboxes, add exercise=TRUE. Make sure it has a unique chunk name. It may look something like this:\n```{r fig2, warning=FALSE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=30,fig.fullwidth=TRUE}\nBefore any interactive code chunks, call the first code chunk ‘setup’.\nThis will pre-load everything that will be used later.\nCheck whether you would like to link any of the interactive code\nsnippets (by default each of them are independent, and only depends on\nthe output of the ‘setup’ chunk) You may want to modify your code\nchunks accordingly.\nDone! Knit the notebook to view outputs as an interactive web page.\nPublish it just like a Shiny app.\nThe entire process took us a few hours of effort and can be incorporated\nto the proof-reading of an R Markdown document. However, we note that as\nin any preparation of research output or web development several\niterations are often needed and the time required increases accordingly\nas the complexity of the analysis increases.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A comparison of minimal examples of a typical .Rmd document and a .Rmd document for an interactive sandbox app.\n\n\n\nIn our implementation in DataLabs\n(https://datalab.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/), the environment and folder\nto create the research is made available to the Shiny app in a read-only\nfashion. Therefore, the authors do not have to worry about versions of\npackages of data or a different software setup. Using DataLabs\nstraightforward visual tools to publish R Shiny apps, we can publish an\nR Markdown notebook with interactive code snippets to reproduce certain\nparts of research readily in a few clicks.\nDeployment\nIn general, learnr tutorial apps can be published the same way\nas R Shiny web apps in Shiny servers, such as the ones provided by cloud\nservice providers or https://shinyapps.io. The learnr\npackage vignettes provide additional help on deployment.\nWe also describe our deployment of these apps in DataLabs, a UK NERC\nvirtual research environment that is being developed. DataLabs is a\ncollaborative virtual research environment (Hollaway et al. 2020) (https://datalab.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/) for environmental scientist\nto work together where data, software, and methods are all centrally\nlocated in projects. DataLabs provide a space for scientists from\ndifferent domains (data science, statisticians, environmental science\nand computer science) to work together and draw on each other’s\nexpertise. It includes an easy-to-use user interface where users can\npublish R Shiny apps with a few clicks, and this applies to these\nnotebooks with interactive code chunks as well. Importantly, when\nprovisioning a instance of R Shiny, this is deployed in a Docker\ncontainer with read-only access to the project data store being used for\nanalysis. This allows an unprecedented level of transparency as parts of\nthe analysis are readily exposed for users to experiment from the exact\nenvironments, datasets (can be large and includes many files), and\nversions of software that created the analysis. The use of Docker\ndeployed onto a Kubernetes infrastructure allows strict limits to be\nplaced on what visitors can do through the use of resource constraints\nand tools such as RAppArmor (Ooms 2013). While access to\nproject files is read-only, some author discretion is still advised to\nensure that visitors should not be able to view or list any private code\nor data. We also note that future releases of learnr will\ncontain external exercise evaluators, so that the code sandboxes can be\nexecuted by an independent engine (such as Google Cloud) and give the\nbenefit of not having to rely on RAppArmor.\nExample: GB rainfall paper\nTo demonstrate our concept, we have turned an R Markdown notebook for one of our recent papers (Tso et al. 2022) into a learnr site\n(https://cptecn-sandboxdemo.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/) using the\nprocedures described in the previous sections. The paper investigates\nthe effect of weather and rainfall types on rainfall chemistry in the\nUK. As can be seen in Figure 2, the code chunks to generate certain\nparts of the paper is exposed. But unlike a static notebook site, the\ncode chunk is not only available for copy and paste but allows users to\nmodify and run on-demand. This makes it very straightforward for user to\nexperiment with various changes of the original analysis, thereby\npromoting transparency and trust.\nSince learnr apps are R Markdown documents, Shiny UI elements\ncan be easily added. We repeat one of the examples by replacing the\ninteractive code box by a simple selector, with minimal modification of\nthe code itself. This approach to publish Shiny apps requires\nsignificantly less work than typical R Shiny web apps since no UI design\nis needed and researchers can rapidly turn an R Markdown document to an R\nShiny web app. For some cases, the use of certain datasets may require a\nlicense, as in this example. A pop-up box is shown when the site is\nloaded and visitors are required to check the boxes to acknowledge the\nuse of the appropriate data licenses (an alternative is to require\nusers to register and load a token file) before they can proceed.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A screenshot of the GB rainfall interactive notebook site. The main feature is the code box. When the site loads, the code that generates the published version of the figure is in the box and the published version of the figure is below it. Users can make edits and re-run the code in the code box and the figure will update accordingly. Users can use the “Start Over” button to see the published version of the code at any point without refreshing the entire site.\n\n\n\nEvaluation\nThe main strength of our approach is that it fills nicely the gap of\nexisting approaches in terms of levels of abstraction. While code and\nmarkdown documents gives full details of the code, standard R Shiny apps\nhas too much limitations on users to interact with the code (Figure 3)\nand users often cannot see the underlying code. Recently, it has become\npopular to publish ‘live’ Jupyter notebooks on Binder and Google Colab.\nWhile this is a great contribution to open science, users are still\nrequired to run and go through the entire notebook step-by-step and\nit can be easy to break it if users change something in between. Our\napproach allows users to interact with portions of the code in a guided\nand isolated manner, without the need to understand all the other parts\nof a notebook or the fear to break it (Table 1). We emphasize that R\nscripts/notebooks and R Shiny apps work well for their intended uses,\nbut our approach adds an additional level of accessibility to users.\nThe openness and ease-to-access our approach provides can benefit many\ndifferent stakeholders (Table 2). Researchers can more rapidly reproduce\nof the analysis of their choice without studying the entire\nnotebook or installing software or downloading all the data. They can\nquickly test alternative hypothesis and stimulate scientific\ndiscussions. For funders, encouraging the use of this approach means\nless time is needed for future projects to pick up results from previous\nwork. And since this is based on learnr which is originally\ndesigned as a tutorial tool, this approach will no doubt speed up the\nprocess to train other users to use similar methods. Overall, it\npromotes open science and make a better value of public funds.\nAn obvious limitation of our approach is that it does not work well for\nideal conditions where other R file formats are designed for. For\ninstance, R scripts and R notebooks are much better suited for more\ncomplex analysis for users to adopt to their own problems. Meanwhile, R\nShiny web apps provides a much richer user experience and is most suited\nwhen the exposed code is generally not useful to stakeholders.\nNevertheless, as discussed above, our approach is designed for users to\nreproduce of an analysis. The user should evaluate these\noptions carefully, paying special attention to the needs of intended\nusers.\nServing notebooks as a web service will inevitably face provenance\nissues. It is surely beneficial if the author’s institution can host\nthese interactive notebooks for a few years after its publication (and\nthat of its related publications). In the future, publishers and data\ncentres may consider providing services to provide longer term\nprovenance of serving these interactive notebooks online. As for any web\napps, funding for the computation servers can be a potential issue. This\nwork uses DataLabs computation time which is part of the UK research\nfunding that develops it. However, a more rigorous funding model may be\nneeded in the future to ensure provenance of these notebooks.\nOur approach focuses on improving reproducibility by exposing parts of R\nscript for users to run them live on an R Shiny web app, leveraging the\noption to render R Markdown documents as R Shiny web apps and the\nlearnr package. It focuses on the R scripts and R Markdown\ndocuments. Users, however, may want to improve reproducibility from the\nopposite direction, namely to allow outputs from an R Shiny web app to\nbe reproducible outside of the Shiny context. For such a requirement, we\nrecommend the use of the shinymeta package,\nwhich allows users to capture the underlying code of selected output\nelements and allows users to download it as well as the underlying data\nto re-create the output in their own R instance. The shinymeta\napproach can be more involved and requires more effort than\nlearnr so we think it is more suitable for users that are\nfocusing their effort on the R Shiny app (particularly the UI). In\nsummary, these two approaches complements each other and we recommend\nusers to consider them to improve reproducibility of their work.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The various levels of abstraction of various types of R documents.

It provides an\nadditional level of abstraction for users to interact with research\noutputs and the codes that generates down. Since it can be linked to the\nenvironment and data that generated the published output and has\nindependent document object identifiers (DOI), it is a suitable\ncandidate to preserve research workflow while exposing parts of it to\nallow rapid experimentation by users. Our work is a demonstration on how\nwe may publish a notebook from virtual research environments such as\nDataLabs, with data, packages, and workflow pre-loaded in a coding\nenvironment, accompanied by rich narratives. While this paper outlines\nthe approach using R, the same approach can benefit other coding\nlanguages such as Python. In fact, this can already be achieved as\nlearnr can run Python chunks (as well as other execution\nengines knitr supports such as SAS and mySQL) as long as the\nusers generate and host the document using R. This paper contributes to\nthe vision towards publishing interactive notebooks as standalone\nresearch outputs and the advancement of open science practices.\nData availability and acknowledgements\nThe GB rainfall example notebook is accessible via this URL\n(https://cptecn-sandboxdemo.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/) and the R\nMarkdown file is deposited in the NERC Environmental Information Data\nCentre (EIDC) (Tso 2022).

    "description": "Longitudinal studies are ubiquitous in medical and clinical research. Sample size computations are critical to ensure that these studies are sufficiently powered to provide reliable and valid inferences. There are several methodologies for calculating sample sizes for longitudinal studies that depend on many considerations including the study design features, outcome type and distribution, and proposed analytical methods. We briefly review the literature and describe sample size formulas for continuous longitudinal data. We then apply the methods using example studies comparing treatment versus control groups in randomized trials assessing treatment effect on clinical outcomes. We also introduce a Shiny app that we developed to assist researchers with obtaining required sample sizes for longitudinal studies by allowing users to enter required pilot estimates. For Alzheimer's studies, the app can estimate required pilot parameters using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate how the package and app can be used to generate sample size and power curves. The package and app are designed to help researchers easily assess the operating characteristics of study designs for Alzheimer's clinical trials and other research studies with longitudinal continuous outcomes.",

    "description": "Propensity score weighting is an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. Besides the inverse probability of treatment weights (IPW), recent development has introduced a general class of balancing weights, corresponding to alternative target populations and estimands. In particular, the overlap weights (OW) lead to optimal covariate balance and estimation efficiency, and a target population of scientific and policy interest. We develop the R package [PSweight](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PSweight) to provide a comprehensive design and analysis platform for causal inference based on propensity score weighting. PSweight supports (i) a variety of balancing weights, (ii) binary and multiple treatments, (iii) simple and augmented weighting estimators, (iv) nuisance-adjusted sandwich variances, and (v) ratio estimands. PSweight also provides diagnostic tables and graphs for covariate balance assessment. We demonstrate the functionality of the package using a data example from the National Child Development Survey (NCDS), where we evaluate the causal effect of educational attainment on income.",

    "description": "Like many predictive models, random forests provide point predictions for new observations. Besides the point prediction, it is important to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction. Prediction intervals provide information about the reliability of the point predictions. We have developed a comprehensive R package, [RFpredInterval](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RFpredInterval), that integrates 16 methods to build prediction intervals with random forests and boosted forests. The set of methods implemented in the package includes a new method to build prediction intervals with boosted forests (PIBF) and 15 method variations to produce prediction intervals with random forests, as proposed by [@roy_prediction_2020]. We perform an extensive simulation study and apply real data analyses to compare the performance of the proposed method to ten existing methods for building prediction intervals with random forests. The results show that the proposed method is very competitive and, globally, outperforms competing methods.",

    "description": "This paper introduces [etrm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=etrm), an R package with tools for trading and financial risk management in energy markets. Contracts for electric power and natural gas differ from most other commodities due to the fact that physical delivery takes place over a time interval, and not at a specific point in time. There is typically strong seasonality, limited storage and transmission capacity and strong correlation between price and required volume. Such characteristics need to be taken into account when pricing contracts and managing financial risk related to energy procurement. Tools for these task are usually bundled into proprietary Energy Trading Risk Management (ETRM) systems delivered by specialized IT vendors. The [etrm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=etrm) package offers a transparent solution for building a forward price curve for energy commodities which is consistent with methods widely used in the industry. The user's fundamental market view may be combined with contract price quotes to form a forward curve that replicate current market prices, as described in @ollmar2003analysis and @benth2007extracting. [etrm](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=etrm) also provides implementations of five portfolio insurance trading strategies for energy price risk management. The forward market curve and the energy price hedging strategies are core elements in an ETRM system, which to the best of the author's knowledge has not been previously available in the R ecosystem.",

Additionally, it implements the extension of FCA to fuzzy datasets and a simplification logic to develop automated reasoning tools. This package is the first to implement FCA techniques in R. Therefore, emphasis has been put on defining classes and methods that could be reusable and extensible by the community. Furthermore, the package incorporates an interface with the [arules](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=arules) package, probably the most used package regarding association rules, closely related to FCA. Finally, we show an application of the use of the package to design a recommender system based on logic for diagnosis in neurological pathologies.",

The frequency modulated Möbius (FMM) model is defined as a parametric signal plus a Gaussian noise, where the signal can be described as a single or a sum of waves. The FMM approach is flexible enough to describe a great variety of rhythmic patterns. The FMM package includes all required functions to fit and explore single and multi-wave FMM models, as well as a restricted version that allows equality constraints between parameters representing a priori knowledge about the shape to be included. Moreover, the FMM package can generate synthetic data and visualize the results of the fitting process. The potential of this methodology is illustrated with examples of such biological oscillations as the circadian rhythm in gene expression, the electrical activity of the heartbeat and the neuronal activity.",

The new method makes use of the representation of a risk or performance estimator as a summation of a time series of influence-function (IF) transformed returns, and computes estimator standard errors using a sophisticated method of estimating the spectral density at frequency zero of the time series of IF-transformed returns. Two additional packages used by RPESE are introduced, namely RPEIF which computes and provides graphical displays of the IF of risk and performance estimators, and RPEGLMEN which implements a regularized Gamma generalized linear model polynomial fit to the periodogram of the time series of the IF-transformed returns. A Monte Carlo study shows that the new method provides more accurate estimates of standard errors for risk and performance estimators compared to well-known alternative methods in the presence of serial correlation.",

    "description": "One of the most common applications of spatial data analysis is detecting zones, at a certain scale, where a point-referenced event under study is especially concentrated. The detection of such zones, which are usually referred to as hotspots, is essential in certain fields such as criminology, epidemiology, or traffic safety. Traditionally, hotspot detection procedures have been developed over areal units of analysis. Although working at this spatial scale can be suitable enough for many research or practical purposes, detecting hotspots at a more accurate level (for instance, at the road segment level) may be more convenient sometimes. Furthermore, it is typical that hotspot detection procedures are entirely focused on the determination of zones where an event is (overall) highly concentrated. It is less common, by far, that such procedures focus on detecting zones where a specific type of event is overrepresented in comparison with the other types observed, which have been denoted as differential risk hotspots. The R package DRHotNet provides several functionalities to facilitate the detection of differential risk hotspots within a linear network. In this paper, DRHotNet is depicted, and its usage in the R console is shown through a detailed analysis of a crime dataset.",

We present and discuss in this paper the three main versions of NKDE: simple, discontinuous, and continuous that are implemented in spNetwork. We illustrate how to apply the three methods and map their results using a sample from a real dataset representing bike accidents in a central neighborhood of Montreal. We also describe the optimization techniques used to reduce calculation time and investigate their impacts when applying the three NKDE to a city-wide dataset.",

    "description": "Randomized response (RR) designs are used to collect response data about sensitive behaviors (e.g., criminal behavior, sexual desires). The modeling of RR data is more complex since it requires a description of the RR process. For the class of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), the RR process can be represented by an adjusted link function, which relates the expected RR to the linear predictor for most common RR designs. The package GLMMRR includes modified link functions for four different cumulative distributions (i.e., logistic, cumulative normal, Gumbel, Cauchy) for GLMs and GLMMs, where the package lme4 facilitates ML and REML estimation. The mixed modeling framework in GLMMRR can be used to jointly analyze data collected under different designs (e.g., dual questioning, multilevel, mixed mode, repeated measurements designs, multiple-group designs). Model-fit tests, tools for residual analyses, and plot functions to give support to a profound RR data analysis are added to the well-known features of the GLM and GLMM software (package lme4). Data of Höglinger and Jann (2018) and Höglinger, Jann, and Diekmann (2014) are used to illustrate the methodology and software.",

    "title": "Visual Diagnostics for Constrained Optimisation with Application to Guided Tours",
    "description": "A guided tour helps to visualise high-dimensional data by showing low-dimensional projections along a projection pursuit optimisation path. Projection pursuit is a generalisation of principal component analysis in the sense that different indexes are used to define the interestingness of the projected data. While much work has been done in developing new indexes in the literature, less has been done on understanding the optimisation. Index functions can be noisy, might have multiple local maxima as well as an optimal maximum, and are constrained to generate orthonormal projection frames, which complicates the optimization. In addition, projection pursuit is primarily used for exploratory data analysis, and finding the local maxima is also useful. The guided tour is especially useful for exploration because it conducts geodesic interpolation connecting steps in the optimisation and shows how the projected data changes as a maxima is approached. This work provides new visual diagnostics for examining a choice of optimisation procedure based on the provision of a new data object which collects information throughout the optimisation. It has helped to diagnose and fix several problems with projection pursuit guided tour. This work might be useful more broadly for diagnosing optimisers and comparing their performance. The diagnostics are implemented in the R package [ferrn](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn).",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nVisualisation is widely used in exploratory data analysis (Tukey 1977; Unwin 2015; Healy 2018; Wilke\n2019). Presenting information in graphics often unveils\ninsights that would otherwise not be discovered and provides a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the problem at hand. Task-specific tools\nsuch as Li et al.\n(2020)\nshow how visualisation can be used to understand, for instance, the\nbehaviour of the optimisation for the example of neural network\nclassification models. However, no general visualisation tool is\navailable for diagnosing optimisation procedures. The work presented in\nthis paper brings visualization tools into optimisation problems with\nthe aim to better understand the performance of optimisers in\npractice.\nThe focus of this paper is on the optimisation problem arising in the\nprojection pursuit guided tour (Buja et al. 2005), an exploratory data\nanalysis technique used for detecting interesting structures in\nhigh-dimensional data through a set of lower-dimensional projections\n(Cook et al.\n2008). The goal of the optimisation is to identify the\nprojection, represented by the projection matrix, that gives the most\ninteresting low-dimensional view. A view is said to be interesting if it\ncan show some structures of the data that depart from normality, such as\nbimodality, clustering, or outliers.\nThe optimization challenges encountered in the projection pursuit\nguided tour problem are common to those of optimization in general.\nExamples include the existence of multiple optima (local and global),\nthe trade-off between computational burden and proximity to the optima,\nor dealing with noisy objective functions that might be non-smooth and\nnon-differentiable (Jones et al. 1998). The visualization\ntools, optimization methods, and conceptual framework presented in this\npaper can therefore be applied to other optimization problems.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section\nprovides an overview of optimisation methods, specifically random search\nand line search methods. A review of the projection pursuit guided tour,\nan overview of the optimisation problem and, outlines of three existing\nalgorithms follows. The third section presents the new visual\ndiagnostics, including the design of a data structure to capture\ninformation during the optimisation, from which several diagnostic plots\nare created. An illustration of how the diagnostic plots can be used to\nexamine the performance of different optimisers and guide improvements\nto existing algorithms is shown using simulated data. Finally, an\nexplanation of the implementation in the R package, ferrn (Zhang et al. 2021), is provided.\nOptimisation methods\nThe type of optimisation problem considered in this paper is\nconstrained optimization (Bertsekas\n2014), assuming it is not possible to find a solution to the\nproblem in the way of a closed-form. That is, the problem consists in\nfinding the minimum or maximum of a function \\(f \\in L^p\\) in the constrained space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), where \\(L^p\\) defines the vector space of function\n\\(f\\), whose \\(p\\)th power is integrable.\nGradient-based methods are commonly used to optimise an objective\nfunction, with the most notable one being the gradient ascent (descent)\nmethod. Although these methods are popular, they rely on the\navailability of the objective function derivatives. As will be shown in\nthe next section, the independent variables in our optimisation problem\nare the entries of a projection matrix, and the computational time\nrequired to perform differentiation on a matrix could impede the\nrendering of tour animation. In addition, some objective functions rely\non the empirical distribution of the data, which makes it in general not\npossible to get the gradient. Hence, gradient-based methods are not the\nfocus of this paper, and consideration will be given to derivative-free\nmethods.\nDerivative-free methods (Conn et al.\n2009; Rios\nand Sahinidis 2013), which do not rely on the knowledge of\nthe gradient, are more generally applicable. Derivative-free methods\nhave been developed over the years, where the emphasis is on finding, in\nmost cases, a near-optimal solution. Here we consider three\nderivative-free methods, two of which are random search methods:\ncreeping random search and simulated annealing, and the other one is\npseudo-derivative search.\nRandom search methods (Romeijn 2009; Zabinsky\n2013; Andradóttir 2015) have a random sampling\ncomponent as part of their algorithms and have been shown to have the\nability to optimise non-convex and non-smooth functions. The initial\nrandom search algorithm, pure random search (Brooks 1958), draws candidate points\nfrom the entire space without using any information of the current\nposition and updates the current position when an improvement on the\nobjective function is made. As the dimension of the space becomes\nlarger, sufficient sampling from the entire space would require a long\ntime for convergence to occur, despite a guaranteed global convergence\n(Spall\n2005). Various algorithms have thus been developed to improve\npure random search by either concentrating on a narrower sampling space\nor using a different updating mechanism. Creeping random search (White 1971) is such a variation, where a\ncandidate point is generated within a neighbourhood of the current\npoint. This makes creeping random search faster to compute but global\nconvergence is no longer guaranteed. On the other hand, simulated\nannealing (Kirkpatrick\net al. 1983; Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis 1993),\nintroduces a different updating mechanism. Rather than only updating the\ncurrent point when an improvement is made, it uses a Metropolis\nacceptance criterion, where worse candidates still have a chance to be\naccepted. The convergence of simulated annealing algorithms has been\nwidely researched (Mitra et al.\n1986; Granville et al. 1994) and the global\noptimum can be attained under mild regularity conditions.\nThe pseudo-derivative search uses a common search scheme in\noptimisation: line search. In line search methods, users are required to\nprovide an initial estimate \\(x_{1}\\)\nand, at each iteration, a search direction \\(S_k\\) and a step size \\(\\alpha_k\\) are generated. Then one moves on\nto the next point following \\(x_{k+1} = x_k +\n\\alpha_kS_k\\) and the process is repeated until the desired\nconvergence is reached. In derivative-free methods, local information of\nthe objective function is used to determine the search direction. The\nchoice of step size also needs consideration, as inadequate step sizes\nmight prevent the optimisation method from converging to an optimum. An\nideal step size can be chosen by finding the value of \\(\\alpha_k \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) that maximises\n\\(f(x_k + \\alpha_kS_k)\\) with respect\nto \\(\\alpha_k\\) at each iteration.\nProjection pursuit guided\ntour\nA projection pursuit guided tour combines two different methods\n(projection pursuit and guided tour) to explore interesting features in\na high-dimensional space. Projection pursuit, coined by Friedman and Tukey\n(1974), detects interesting structures\n(e.g., clustering, outliers, and skewness) in multivariate data via\nlow-dimensional projections. Guided tour (Cook et al. 1995) is one variation of a\nbroader class of data visualisation methods, tour (Buja et al. 2005), which displays\nhigh-dimensional data through a series of animated projections.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{X}_{n \\times p}\\) be\nthe data matrix with \\(n\\) observations\nin \\(p\\) dimensions. A \\(d\\)-dimensional projection is a linear\ntransformation from \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\)\ninto \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) defined as \\(\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{X} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}\\),\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{n \\times d}\\) is\nthe projected data and \\(\\mathbf{A}_{p\\times\nd}\\) is the projection matrix. We define \\(f: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\mapsto\n\\mathbb{R}\\) to be an index function that maps the projected data\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) onto a scalar value.\nThis is commonly known as the projection pursuit index function, or just\nindex function, and is used to measure the “interestingness” of a given\nprojection. An interesting projection shows structures that are\nnon-normal since theoretical proofs from Diaconis and Freedman (1984) have shown that projections tend\nto be normal as \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) approach infinity under certain\nconditions. There have been many index functions proposed in the\nliterature, here are a few examples: early indexes that can be\ncategorised as measuring the \\(L^2\\)\ndistance between the projection and a normal distribution: Legendre\nindex (Friedman and\nTukey 1974); Hermite index (Hall 1989); natural Hermite index (Cook et al.\n1993); chi-square index (Posse 1995) for detecting spiral\nstructure; LDA index (Lee et al. 2005) and PDA (Lee and Cook\n2010) index for supervised classification; kurtosis index\n(Loperfido\n2020) and skewness index (Loperfido 2018) for detecting outliers\nin financial time series; and most recently, scagnostic indexes (Laa and Cook 2020) for summarising\nstructures in scatterplot matrices based on eight scagnostic measures\n(Wilkinson et al. 2005; Wilkinson and Wills 2008).\nAs a general visualisation method, tour produces animations of\nhigh-dimensional data via rotations of low-dimensional planes. There are\ndifferent versions depending on how the high-dimensional space is\ninvestigated: grand tour (Cook et al. 2008) selects the planes\nrandomly to provide a general overview; manual tour (Cook and Buja\n1997) gradually phases in and out one variable to understand\nthe contribution of that variable in the projection. Guided tour, the\nmain interest of this paper, chooses the planes with the aid of\nprojection pursuit to gradually reveal the most interesting projection.\nGiven a random start, projection pursuit iteratively finds bases with\nhigher index values, and the guided tour constructs a geodesic\ninterpolation between these planes to form a tour path. Figure\n1 shows a sketch of the tour path where the blue\nsquares represent planes (targets) selected by the projection pursuit\noptimisation, and the white squares represent planes in the geodesic\ninterpolation between targets. Mathematical details of the geodesic\ninterpolation can be found in Buja et al. (2005).\n(Note that the term frame used in Buja’s paper refers to a\nparticular set of orthonormal vectors defining a plane. This is also\nconventionally referred to as a basis, which is used in this paper and\nthe associated software.) The aforementioned tour method has been\nimplemented in the R package tourr (Wickham et al. 2011).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An illustration for demonstrating the frames in a tour\npath. Each square (frame) represents the projected data with a\ncorresponding basis. Blue frames are returned by the projection pursuit\noptimisation and white frames are constructed between two blue frames by\ngeodesic interpolation.\n\n\n\nOptimisation in the tour\nIn projection pursuit, the optimisation aims at finding the global\nand local maxima that give interesting projections according to an index\nfunction. That is, it starts with a given randomly selected basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_1\\) and aims at finding an\noptimal final projection basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_T\\) that satisfies the following\noptimisation problem:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\arg \\max_{\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathcal{A}} f(\\mathbf{X} \\cdot\n\\mathbf{A})  ~~~ s.t. ~~~ \\mathbf{A}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A} = I_d \\,,\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) are defined as in the previous\nsection, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is the set of\nall \\(p\\)-dimensional projection bases,\n\\(I_d\\) is the \\(d\\)-dimensional identity matrix, and the\nconstraint ensures the projection bases, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), to be orthonormal. It is\nworth noticing the following: 1) The optimisation is constrained, and\nthe orthonormality constraint imposes a geometrical structure on the\nbases space: it forms a Stiefel manifold. 2) There may be index\nfunctions for which the objective function might not be differentiable.\n3) While finding the global optimum is the goal of the optimisation\nproblem, interesting projections may also appear in the local optimum.\n4) The optimisation should be fast to compute since the tour animation\nis viewed by the users during the optimisation.\nExisting algorithms\nThree optimisers have been implemented in the tourr\n(Wickham et al. 2011) package: creeping\nrandom search (CRS), simulated annealing (SA), and pseudo-derivative\n(PD). Creeping random search (CRS) is a random search optimiser that\nsamples a candidate basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) in the neighbourhood of\nthe current basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{cur}}\\) by \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l} = (1-\n\\alpha)\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{cur}} + \\alpha\n\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{rand}}\\) where \\(\\alpha \\in [0,1]\\) controls the radius of\nthe sampling neighbourhood and \\(\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{rand}}\\) is generated\nrandomly. \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) is then\northonormalised to fulfil the basis constraint. If \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) has an index value higher\nthan the current basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{cur}}\\), the optimiser\noutputs \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) for a guided\ntour to construct an interpolation path. The neighbourhood parameter\n\\(\\alpha\\) is adjusted by a cooling\nparameter: \\(\\alpha_{j+1} = \\alpha_j *\n\\text{cooling}\\) before the next iteration starts. The optimiser\nterminates when the maximum number of iteration \\(l_{\\max}\\) is reached before a better basis\ncan be found. The algorithm of CRS can be found in the appendix. Posse (1995)\nhas proposed a slightly different cooling scheme by introducing a\nhalving parameter \\(c\\). In his\nproposal, \\(\\alpha\\) is only adjusted\nif the last iteration takes more than \\(c\\) times to find a better basis.\nSimulated annealing (SA) uses the same sampling process as CRS but\nallows a probabilistic acceptance of a basis with lower index value than\nthe current one. Given an initial value of \\(T_0 \\in \\mathbb{R^{+}}\\), the “temperature”\nat iteration \\(l\\) is defined as \\(T(l) = \\frac{T_0}{\\log(l + 1)}\\). When a\ncandidate basis fails to have an index value larger than the current\nbasis, SA gives it a second chance to be accepted with probability \\[P= \\min\\left\\{\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\mid\nI_{\\text{cur}} - I_{l} \\mid}{T(l)}\\right],1\\right\\} \\,,\\] where\n\\(I_{(\\cdot)} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) denotes\nthe index value of a given basis. This implementation allows the\noptimiser to make a move and explore the basis space even if the\ncandidate basis does not have a higher index value. Hence it enables the\noptimiser to jump out of a local optimum. The second algorithm in the\nappendix highlights how SA differs from CRS in the inner loop.\nPseudo-derivative (PD) search uses a different strategy than CRS and\nSA. Rather than randomly sample the basis space, PD first computes a\nsearch direction by evaluating bases close to the current basis. The\nstep size is then chosen along the corresponding geodesic by another\noptimisation over a 90 degree angle from \\(-\\pi/4\\) to \\(\\pi/4\\). The resulting candidate basis\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_{**}\\) is returned for the\ncurrent iteration if it has a higher index value than the current one.\nThe third algorithm in the appendix summarises the inner loop of the\nPD.\nVisual diagnostics\nA data structure for diagnosing optimisers in projection pursuit\nguided tour is first defined. With this data structure, four types of\ndiagnostic plots are presented.\nData structure for\ndiagnostics\nThree main pieces of information are recorded during the projection\npursuit optimisation: 1) projection bases \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), 2) index values \\(I\\), and 3) state \\(S\\). For CRS and SA, possible states\ninclude random_search, new_basis, and\ninterpolation. Pseudo-derivative (PD) has a wider variety\nof states, including new_basis,\ndirection_search, best_direction_search,\nbest_line_search, and interpolation. Multiple\niterators index the information collected at different levels: \\(t\\) is a unique identifier prescribing the\nnatural ordering of each observation; \\(j\\) and \\(l\\) are the counter of the outer and inner\nloop, respectively. Other parameters of interest recorded, \\(V\\), include method that tags\nthe name of the optimiser, and alpha that indicates the\nsampling neighbourhood size for searching observations. A matrix\nnotation describing the data structure is:\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\n\\(I\\)\n\\(S\\)\n\\(j\\)\n\\(l\\)\n\\(V_{1}\\)\n\\(V_{2}\\)\nDescription\n\\(1\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_1\\)\n\\(I_1\\)\n\\(S_1\\)\n1\n1\n\\(V_{11}\\)\n\\(V_{12}\\)\nstart basis\n\\(2\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_2\\)\n\\(I_2\\)\n\\(S_2\\)\n2\n1\n\\(V_{21}\\)\n\\(V_{22}\\)\nsearch\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n2\n\\(l_2\\)\n…\n…\nsearch (accepted)\n…\n…\n…\n…\n2\n1\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n2\n\\(k_2\\)\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J\\)\n1\n…\n…\nsearch\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(T\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_T\\)\n\\(I_T\\)\n\\(S_T\\)\n\\(J\\)\n\\(l_J\\)\n\\(V_{T1}\\)\n\\(V_{T2}\\)\nsearch (final)\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J\\)\n1\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J\\)\n\\(k_J\\)\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J+1\\)\n1\n…\n…\nsearch (last round)\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(T^{\\prime}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_{T^{\\prime}}\\)\n\\(I_{T^{\\prime}}\\)\n\\(S_{T^{\\prime}}\\)\n\\(J+1\\)\n\\(l_{J+1}\\)\n\\(V_{{T}^{\\prime}1}\\)\n\\(V_{{T}^{\\prime}2}\\)\nsearch (last round)\nwhere \\(T^{\\prime} = T + k_{J}+\nl_{J+1}\\). Note that there is no output in iteration \\(J + 1\\) since the optimiser does not find a\nbetter basis in the last iteration and terminates. The final basis found\nis \\(A_T\\) with index value \\(I_T\\).\nThe data structure constructed above meets the tidy data principle\n(Wickham\n2014) that requires each observation to form a row and each\nvariable to form a column. With tidy data structure, data wrangling and\nvisualisation can be significantly simplified by well-developed packages\nsuch as dplyr\n(Wickham et al. 2020) and ggplot2 (Wickham 2016).\nDiagnostic\n1: Checking how hard the optimiser is working\nA starting point of diagnosing an optimiser is to understand how many\nsearches it has conducted, i.e., we want to summarise how the index is\nincreasing over iterations and how many basis need to be sampled at each\niteration. This is achieved using the function\nexplore_trace_search(): a boxplot shows the distribution of\nindex values for each try, where the accepted basis (corresponding to\nthe highest index value) is always shown as a point. When there are only\nfew tries at a given iteration, showing the data points directly is\npreferred over the boxplot and this is controlled via the\ncutoff argument. Additional annotations are added to\nfacilitate better reading of the plot, and these include 1) the number\nof points searched in each iteration can be added as text label at the\nbottom of each iteration; 2) the anchor bases to interpolate are\nconnected and highlighted in a larger size; 3) the colour of the last\niteration is in greyscale to indicate no better basis found in this\niteration.\nFigure 2 shows an example of the search plot for\nCRS (left) and SA (right). Both optimisers quickly find better bases in\nthe first few iterations and then take longer to find one in the later\niterations. The anchor bases, the ones found with the highest index\nvalue in each iteration, always have an increased index value in the\noptimiser CRS while this is not the case for SA. This feature gives CRS\nan advantage in this simple example to quickly find the optimum.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A comparison of the searches by two optimisers: CRS\n(left) and SA (right) on a 2D projection problem of a six-variable\ndataset, using the holes index. Both optimisers reach the final basis\nwith a similar index value, while it takes SA longer to find the final\nbasis. In the earlier iterations, optimisers quickly find a better basis\nto proceed, while in the later iterations, most sampled bases fail to\nmake an improvement on the index value, and a boxplot is used to\nsummarise the distribution of the index values. There is no better basis\nfound in the last iteration, 9 (left) and 15 (right), before reaching\nthe maximum number of try and hence it is coloured grey. The colour\nscale is from the customised botanical palette in the\nferrn package.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 2: Examining the optimisation\nprogress\nAnother interesting feature to examine is the changes in the index\nvalue between interpolating bases since the projection on these bases is\nshown in the tour animation. Trace plots are created by plotting the\nindex value against time. Figure 3 presents the trace\nplot of the same optimisations as Figure 2, and one\ncan observe that the trace is smooth in both cases. It may seem bizarre\nat first sight that the interpolation sometimes passes bases with higher\nindex values before it decreases to a lower target. This happens\nbecause, on the one hand, the probabilistic acceptance in SA implies\nthat some worse bases will be accepted by the optimiser. In addition,\nthe guided tour interpolates between the current and target basis to\nprovide a smooth transition between projections, and sometimes a higher\nindex value will be observed along the interpolation path. This\nindicates that a non-monotonic interpolation cannot be avoided, even for\nCRS. Later, in Section A problem of non-monotonicity, there\nwill be a discussion on improving the non-monotonic interpolation for\nCRS.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An inspection of the index values as the optimisation\nprogress for two optimisers: CRS (left) and SA (right). The holes index\nis optimised for a 2D projection problem on the six-variable dataset .\nLines indicate the interpolation, and dots indicate new target bases\ngenerated by the optimisers. Interpolation in both optimisation is\nsmooth, while SA is observed to first pass by some bases with higher\nindex values before reaching the target bases in time 76-130.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 3a: Understanding the optimiser’s coverage\nof the search space\nApart from checking the search and progression of an optimiser,\nlooking at where the bases are positioned in the basis space is also of\ninterest. Given the orthonormality constraint, the space of projection\nbases \\(\\mathbf{A}_{p \\times d}\\) is a\nStiefel manifold. For one-dimensional projections, this forms a \\(p\\)-dimensional sphere. A dimensionality\nreduction method, e.g., principal component analysis, is applied to\nfirst project all the bases onto a 2D space. In a projection pursuit\nguided tour optimisation, there are various types of bases involved: 1)\nThe starting basis; 2) The search bases that the optimiser evaluated to\nproduce the anchor bases; 3) The anchor bases that have the highest\nindex value in each iteration; 4) The interpolating bases on the\ninterpolation path; and finally, 5) the end basis. The importance of\nthese bases differs but the most important ones are the starting,\ninterpolating, and end bases. Sometimes, two optimisers can start with\nthe same basis but finish with bases of opposite signs. This happens\nbecause the projection is invariant to the orientation of the basis, and\nso is the index value. However, this creates difficulties for comparing\nthe optimisers since the end bases will be symmetric to the origin. A\nsign flipping step is conducted to flip the signs of all the bases in\none routine if different optimisations finish at opposite places.\nSeveral annotations have been made to help understand this plot. As\nmentioned previously, the original basis space is a high-dimensional\nsphere, and random bases on the sphere can be generated via the geozoo (Schloerke 2016) package. We use PCA to\nproject and visualize the parameters/ bases in 2D. The centre of the 2D\nview is the first two PCs of the data matrix. It theoretically should be\na circle but may have some irregular edges due to finite sampling. Thus\nthe edge is smoothed by using a radius estimated as the largest distance\nfrom the centre to any basis. In the simulation, the theoretical best\nbasis is known and can be labelled to compare how close to this that the\noptimisers stopped. Various aesthetics, i.e., size, alpha\n(transparency), and colour, are applicable to emphasize critical\nelements and adjust for the presentation. For example, anchor points and\nsearch points are less important, and hence a smaller size and alpha are\nused. Alpha can also be applied on the interpolation paths to show start\nto finish from transparent to opaque.\nFigure 4 shows the PCA plot of CRS and PD for a 1D\nprojection problem. Both optimisers find the optimum, but PD gets\ncloser. With the PCA plot, one can visually appreciate the nature of\nthese two optimisers: PD first evaluates points in a small neighbourhood\nfor a promising direction, while CRS evaluates points randomly in the\nsearch space to search for the next target. There are dashed lines\nannotated for CRS, and it describes the interruption of the\ninterpolation, which will be discussed in detail in Section A\nproblem of non-monotonicity.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Search paths of CRS (green) and PD (brown) in the\nPCA-reduced basis space for 1D projection problem on the five-variable\ndataset, using holes index. The basis space, a 5D unit sphere, is\nprojected onto a 2D circle by PCA. The black star represents the\ntheoretical best basis the optimisers are aiming to find. All the bases\nin PD have been flipped for easier comparison of the final bases, and a\ngrey dashed line has been annotated to indicate the symmetry of the two\nstart bases.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 3b:\nAnimating the diagnostic plots\nAnimation is another type of display to show how the search\nprogresses from start to finish in the space. Figure\n5 shows the animated version (six\nframes from the animation if viewed in pdf) of the PCA plot in Figure\n4. An additional piece of information one can learn from\nthis animation is that CRS finds its end basis quicker than PD since CRS\nfinishes its search in the 5th frame while PD is still making more\nprogress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Animated version of Figure 4. With\nanimation, the progression of the search paths from start to finish can\nbetter identified and CRS (green) finishes the optimisation quicker than\nPD (brown).\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 4a: The\ntour looking at itself\nAs mentioned previously, the original \\(p\n\\times d\\) dimension space can be simulated via randomly\ngenerated bases in the geozoo (Schloerke 2016) package. While the PCA\nplot projects the bases from the direction that maximises the variance,\nthe tour plot displays the original high-dimensional space from various\ndirections using animation. Figure 6 shows\nsome frames from the tour plot of the same two optimisations in its\noriginal space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Animating the two paths from Figure 4 and 5\nin the full basis space. The full basis space in this example is a 5D\nunit sphere, on which points (grey) are randomly generated via the CRAN\npackage geozoo.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 4b: Forming a\ntorus\nWhile the previous few examples have looked at the space of 1D basis\nin a unit sphere, this section visualises the space of 2D basis. Recall\nthat the columns in a 2D basis are orthogonal to each other, so the\nspace of \\(p \\times 2\\) bases is a\ntorus in the \\(p\\)-D space (Buja and Asimov 1986). For \\(p = 3\\) one would see a classical 3D torus\nshape as shown by the grey points in Figure\n7. The two circles of the torus can be\nobserved to be perpendicular to each other and this can be linked back\nto the orthogonality condition. Two paths from CRS and PD are plotted on\ntop of the torus and coloured in green and brown, respectively, to match\nthe previous plots. The final basis found by PD and CRS are shown in a\nlarger shape and printed below, respectively:\n\n             [,1]        [,2]\n[1,]  0.001196285  0.03273881\n[2,] -0.242432715  0.96965761\n[3,] -0.970167484 -0.24226493\n\n\n            [,1]         [,2]\n[1,]  0.05707994 -0.007220138\n[2,] -0.40196202 -0.915510160\n[3,] -0.91387549  0.402230054\n\nBoth optimisers have found the third variable in the first direction\nand the second variable in the second direction. Note, however, the\ndifferent orientation of the basis, following from the different sign in\nthe second column. One would expect to see this in the torus plot as the\nfinal bases match each other when projected onto one torus circle (due\nto the same sign in the first column) and are symmetric when projected\nonto the other (due to the different sign in the second column). In\nFigure 7, this can be seen most clearly in\nframe 5 where the two circles are rotated into a line from our view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Animation of rotating the 2D basis space\nalong with two search paths optimised by PD (brown) and CRS (green). The\nprojection problem is a 2D projection with three variables using the\nholes index. The grey points are randomly generated 2D projection bases\nin the space and it can be observed that these points form a torus.\n\n\n\nDiagnosing an optimiser\nIn this section, several examples will be presented to show how the\ndiagnostic plots discover something unexpected in projection pursuit\noptimisation, and guide the implementation of new features.\nSimulation setup\nRandom variables with different distributions have been simulated as\nfollows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_1 \\overset{d}{=} x_8 \\overset{d}{=} x_9 \\overset{d}{=} x_{10}&\n\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\\\\nx_2 &\\sim 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(-3, 1) + 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(3, 1)\\\\\n\\Pr(x_3) &=\n\\begin{cases}\n0.5 & \\text{if $x_3 = -1$ or $1$}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\\\\nx_4 &\\sim 0.25 \\mathcal{N}(-3, 1) + 0.75 \\mathcal{N}(3, 1)\\\\\nx_5 &\\sim \\frac{1}{3} \\mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + \\frac{1}{3}\n\\mathcal{N}(0, 1) + \\frac{1}{3} \\mathcal{N}(5, 1)\\\\\nx_6 &\\sim 0.45 \\mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + 0.1 \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) + 0.45\n\\mathcal{N}(5, 1)\\\\\nx_7 &\\sim 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(5, 1)\n\\end{align}\\]\nVariables x1, x8 to x10 are\nnormal noise with zero mean, and unit variance and x2 to\nx7 are normal mixtures with varied weights and locations.\nAll the variables have been scaled to have overall unit variance before\nprojection pursuit. The holes index (Cook et al. 2008), used for detecting\nbimodality of the variables, is used throughout the examples unless\notherwise specified.\nA problem of non-monotonicity\nAn example of non-monotonic interpolation has been given in Figure\n3: a path that passes bases with a higher index value\nthan the target one. For SA, a non-monotonic interpolation is justified\nsince target bases do not necessarily have a higher index value than the\ncurrent one, while this is not the case for CRS. The original trace plot\nfor a 2D projection problem, optimised by CRS, is shown on the left\npanel of Figure 8, and one can observe that the\nnon-monotonic interpolation has undermined the optimiser to realise its\nfull potential. Hence, an interruption is implemented to stop at the\nbest basis found in the interpolation. The right panel of Figure\n8 shows the trace plot after implementing the\ninterruption, and while the first two interpolations are identical, the\nbasis at time 61 has a higher index value than the target in the third\ninterpolation. Rather than starting the next iteration from the target\nbasis on time 65, CRS starts the next iteration at time 61 on the right\npanel and reaches a better final basis.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Comparison of the interpolation before and after\nimplementing the interruption for the 2D projection problem on data\nusing holes index, optimised by CRS. On the left panel, the basis with a\nhigher index value is found during the interpolation but not used. On\nthe right panel, the interruption stops the interpolation at the basis\nwith the highest index value for each iteration and results in a final\nbasis with a higher index value, as shown on the right panel.\n\n\n\nClose but not close enough\nOnce the final basis has been found by an optimiser, one may want to\npush further in the close neighbourhood to see if an even better basis\ncan be found. A polish search takes the final basis of an optimiser as\nthe start of a new guided tour to search for local improvements. The\npolish algorithm is similar to the CRS but with three distinctions: 1) a\nhundred rather than one candidate bases are generated each time in the\ninner loop; 2) the neighbourhood size is reduced in the inner loop,\nrather than in the outer loop; and 3) three more termination conditions\nhave been added to ensure the new basis generated is distinguishable\nfrom the current one in terms of the distance in the space, the relative\nchange in the index value, and neighbourhood size:\nthe distance between the basis found and the current needs to be\nlarger than 1e-3;\nthe relative change of the index value needs to be larger than 1e-5;\nand\nthe alpha parameter needs to be larger than 0.01.\nFigure 9 presents the projected data and trace plot of\na 2D projection, optimised by CRS and followed by the polish step. The\ntop row shows the initial projection, the final projection after CRS,\nand the final projection after polish, respectively. The end basis found\nby CRS reveals the four clusters in the data, but the edges of each\ncluster are not clean-cut. Polish works with this end basis and further\npushes the index value to produce clearer edges of the cluster,\nespecially along the vertical axis.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of the projected data before and after using\npolishing for a 2D projection problem on data using holes index. The top\nrow shows the initial projected data and the final views after CRS and\npolish search, and the second row traces the index value. The clustering\nstructure in the data is detected by CRS (top middle panel), but the\npolish step improves the index value and produces clearer boundaries of\nthe clusters (top right panel), especially along the vertical axis. Note\nthat the parameter is set to 400 in this experiment for CRS to do its\nbest.\n\n\n\nSeeing the signal in the\nnoise\nThe holes index function used for all the examples before this\nsection produces a smooth interpolation, while this is not the case for\nall the indexes. An example of a noisy index function for 1D projections\ncompares the projected data, \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{n\n\\times 1}\\), to a randomly generated normal distribution, \\(\\mathcal{N}_{n \\times 1}\\), using the\nKolmogorov test. Let \\(F_{.}(n)\\) be\nthe empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) with two possible\nsubscripts, \\(Y\\) and \\(\\mathcal{N}\\), representing the projected\nand randomly generated data, and \\(n\\)\ndenoting the number of observations, the Kolmogorov index \\(I^{nk}(n)\\), is defined as:\n\\[I^{K}(n) = \\max \\left[F_{Y}(n) -\nF_{\\mathcal{N}}(n)\\right].\\] With a non-smooth index function,\ntwo research questions are raised:\nwhether any optimiser fails to optimise this non-smooth index;\nand\nwhether the optimisers can find the global optimum despite the\npresence of a local optimum.\nFigure 10 presents the trace and PCA plots of\nall three optimisers, and as expected, none of the interpolated paths\nare smooth. There is barely any improvement made by PD, indicating its\nfailure in optimising non-smooth index functions. While CRS and SA have\nmanaged to get close to the index value of the theoretical best, the\ntrace plot shows that it takes SA much longer to find the final basis.\nThis long interpolation path is partially due to the fluctuation in the\nearly iterations, where SA tends to generously accept inferior bases\nbefore concentrating near the optimum. The PCA plot shows the\ninterpolation path and search points, excluding the last termination\niteration. Pseudo-Derivative (PD) quickly gets stuck near the starting\nposition. Comparing the amount of random search done by CRS and SA, it\nis surprising that SA does not carry as many samples as CRS. Combining\nthe insights from both the trace and PCA plot, one can learn the two\ndifferent search strategies by CRS and SA: CRS frequently samples in the\nspace and only make a move when an improvement is guaranteed to be made,\nwhile SA first broadly accepts bases in the space and then starts the\nextensive sampling in a narrowed subspace. The specific decision of\nwhich optimiser to use will depend on the index curve in the basis\nspace, but if the basis space is non-smooth, accepting inferior bases at\nfirst, as SA has done here, can lead to a more efficient search in terms\nof the overall number of points evaluated.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of the three optimisers in optimising\n\\(I^{nk}(n)\\) index for a 1D projection\nproblem on a five-variable dataset, . Both CRS and SA succeed in the\noptimisation, PD fails to optimise this non-smooth index. Further, SA\ntakes much longer than CRS to finish the optimisation, but finishes off\ncloser to the theoretical best.\n\n\n\nThe next experiment compares the performance of CRS and SA when a\nlocal maximum exists. Two search neighbourhood sizes, 0.5 and 0.7, are\ncompared to understand how a large search neighbourhood would affect the\nfinal basis and the length of the search. Figure 11\nshows 80 paths simulated using 20 seeds in the PCA plot, faceted by the\noptimiser and search size. With CRS and a search size of 0.5, despite\nbeing the simplest and fastest, the optimiser fails in three instances\nwhere the final basis lands neither near the local nor the global\noptimum. With a larger search size of 0.7, more seeds have found the\nglobal maximum. Comparing CRS and SA for a search size of 0.5, SA does\nnot seem to improve the final basis found, despite having longer\ninterpolation paths. However, the denser paths near the local maximum\nare an indicator that SA is working hard to examine if there is any\nother optimum in the basis space, but the relatively small search size\nhas diminished its ability to reach the global maximum. With a larger\nsearch size, almost all the seeds (16 out of 20) have found the global\nmaximum, and some final bases are much closer to the theoretical best,\nas compared to the three other cases. This indicates that SA, with a\nreasonable large search window, is able to overcome the local optimum\nand optimise close towards the global optimum.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Comparing 20 search paths in the PCA-projected basis\nspace faceted by two optimisers: CRS and SA, and two search sizes: 0.5\nand 0.7. The optimisation is on the 1D projection index, \\(I^{nk}(n)\\), for data, where a local\noptimum, annotated by the cross (x), is presented in this experiment,\nalong with the global optimum (*).\n\n\n\nReconciling the orientation\nOne interesting situation observed in the previous examples is that,\nfor some simulations, as shown on the left panel of Figure\n12, the target basis is generated on the other half of\nthe basis space, and the interpolator seems to draw a straight line to\ninterpolate. Bases with opposite signs do not affect the projection and\nindex value, but we would prefer the target to have the same orientation\nas the current basis. The orientation of two bases can be\ncomputationally checked by calculating the determinant – a negative\nvalue suggests the two bases have a different orientation. For 1D bases,\nthis can be corrected by flipping the sign on one basis. For higher\ndimensions, it can be a bit more difficult because the orthonormality of\nthe basis needs to be also maintained when an individual vector is\nflipped. Here, an orientation check is carried out once a new target\nbasis is generated, and the sign in the target basis will be flipped if\na negative determinant is obtained. The interpolation after implementing\nthe orientation check is shown on the right panel of Figure\n12, where the unsatisfactory interpolation no longer\nexists.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Comparison of the interpolation in the PCA-projected\nbasis space before and after reconciling the orientation of the target\nbasis. Optimisation is on the 1D projection index, \\(I^{nk}(n)\\), for boa6 data using CRS with\nseed 2463. The dots represent the target basis in each iteration, and\nthe path shows the interpolation. On the left panel, one target basis is\ngenerated with an opposite orientation to the current basis (hence\nappear on the other side of the basis space), and the interpolator\ncrosses the origin to perform the interpolation. The right panel shows\nthe same interpolation after implementing an orientation check, and the\nundesirable interpolation disappears.\n\n\n\nImplementation\nThis project contributes to the software development in two packages:\na data collection object is implemented in tourr (Wickham et al. 2011), while the visual\ndiagnostics of the optimisers is implemented in ferrn\n(Zhang et al. 2021).

The methods were illustrated\nusing the optimisers available for projection pursuit guided tour. Here\nthe constraint is the orthonormality condition of the projection bases,\nwhich corresponds to optimisation over spheres and torii. The approach\ndescribed broadly applies to other constrained optimisers. Although the\nmanifold in \\(p\\)-space might be\ndifferent the diagnostic techniques are the same. A researcher would\nbegin by saving the path of the optimiser in a form required to input\ninto the ferrn package, as described in this paper. One might generally\nmake more samples from the constrained space upon which to assess and\ncompare the optimisation paths. These high-dimensional data objects can\nthen be viewed using the tour.\nThe progressive optimisation of a target function and its coverage of\nthe search space can be viewed in both reduced 2D space and the full\nspace. These visualisations can lead to insights for evaluating and\ncomparing the performance of multiple optimisers operating on the same\ntask. They can provide a better understanding of existing methods or\nmotivate the development of new approaches. For example, we have\ncompared how three optimisers perform when maximising a non-smooth index\nfunction and have illustrated how the pseudo-derivative search fails in\nthis setting. The observations from our experiments have also been\ntranslated into improved optimisation methods for the guided tour, e.g.,\nwe introduced the option to interrupt the search if a better basis is\nfound along the path.\nThis work might be considered an effort to bring transparency into\nalgorithms. Although little attention is paid by algorithm developers to\nproviding ways to output information during intermediate steps, this is\nan important component for enabling others to understand and diagnose\nthe performance. Algorithms are an essential component of artificial\nintelligence that is used to make daily life easier. Interpretability of\nalgorithms is important to guard against aspects like bias and\ninappropriate use. The data object underlying the visual diagnostics\nhere is an example of what might be useful in algorithm development\ngenerally.\nAcknowledgements\nThis article is created using knitr (Xie 2015) and rmarkdown (Xie et al. 2018) in R.

    "description": "Welch’s two-sample t-test based on least squares (LS) estimators is generally used to test the equality of two normal means when the variances are not equal. However, this test loses its power when the underlying distribution is not normal. In this paper, two different tests are proposed to test the equality of two long-tailed symmetric (LTS) means under heterogeneous variances. Adaptive modified maximum likelihood (AMML) estimators are used in developing the proposed tests since they are highly efficient under LTS distribution. An R package called RobustBF is given to show the implementation of these tests. Simulated Type I error rates and powers of the proposed tests are also given and compared with Welch’s t-test based on LS estimators via an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study.",

    "contents": "\nGenesis: How did we get here?\nThe article “Software Engineering and R Programming: A Call to\nAction” summarizes the dichotomy between analytics and software\nengineering in the R ecosystem, provides examples where this leads to\nproblems and proposes what we as R users can do to bridge the gap.\nData Analytic Language\nThe fundamental basis of the dichotomy is inherent in the evolution\nof S and R: they are not programming languages, but they ended up being\nmistaken for such. S was designed to be a data analytic\nlanguage: to turn ideas into software quickly and faithfully, often used\nin “non-programming” style (Chambers 1998). Its original goal was to\nenable the statisticians to apply code which was written in programming\nlanguages (at the time mostly FORTRAN) to analyze data quickly and\ninteractively - for some suitable definition of “interactive” at the\ntime (Becker 1994). The success of S and then\nR can be traced to the ability to perform data analysis by applying\nexisting tools to data in creative ways. A data analysis is a quest - at\nevery step we learn more about the data which informs our decision about\nnext steps. Whether it is an exploratory data analysis leveraging\ngraphics or computing statistics or fitting models - the final goal is\ntypically not known ahead of time, it is obtained by an iterative\nprocess of applying tools that we as analysts think may lead us further\n(Tukey 1977). It is important to note\nthat this is exactly the opposite of software engineering where there is\na well-defined goal: a specification or desired outcome, which simply\nneeds to be expressed in a way understandable to the computer.\nFreedom for All\nThe second important design aspect rooted in the creativity required\nis the freedom the language provides. Given that the language can be\ncomputed upon means that a given expression may have different meaning\ndepending on how the called function decides to treat it and such\ndeviations are not entirely uncommon, typically referred to as\nnon-standard evaluation. Probably the best example is the sub-language\ndefined by the data.table\npackage (Dowle and Srinivasan\n2021) featuring the := operator which is parsed,\nbut not even used by the R language.\nAnalogously, there is no specific, prescribed object system, but\nrather one is free to implement any idea desirable, as witnessed by the\nfact that there are more than a handful of object system definitions\navailable in R and contributed packages. This freedom is what makes R\ngreat for experimentation with new ideas or concepts, but very hard to\ntreat as a programming language.\nWe have a language that is built on the idea of applying tools and\nwhich allows freedom to express new ideas so the last important step is\nhow to define new tools. R add-on packages (R Core\nTeam 2021) are the vehicle by which new tools can be defined\nand distributed to R users. Note that true to design goals, packages are\nnot limited to R code but rather can also include code written in\nprogramming languages such as C, C++ or Fortran. That in turn makes it\npossible to write packages that expand the scope of tools to other\nlanguages such as Java with RJava (Urbanek 2021) or Python with reticulate\n(Ushey et al.\n2022) simply by creating an R package which defines the\ninterface.\nSharing Packages\nBut this is also where we are entering the realm of software\nengineering. Now we are in the business of defining the tools\nas opposed to just using the tools. It also means that the\ntools have to worry about programming interfaces, defining behavior and\nall those pesky things we as statisticians don’t want to worry about.\nAlthough we originally started as R users, the moment we want\nto share any re-usable piece of code with others we are becoming\ndevelopers. Since no developer would mistake R for a\nprogramming language, it is analysts with background in various fields\nwhich use statistics one way or another that are more likely to\nuse R. However, as we become more comfortable with R, we start\nusing it as a programming language, not just analytic language, often\nbecause it is simply more convenient than having to learn a programming\nlanguage. This explains the empirical evidence (Pinto et\nal. 2018) of R package authors not being trained software\nengineers, but often scientists from other fields and any consequences\nthereof.\nHowever, as R packages started to emerge, it became clear that a\nloosely coupled structure is not enough and have to introduce software\nengineering concepts such as documentation and testing. R includes tools\nfor automated checking for packages to be able to provide at least some\nbasic guarantees. Packages provide examples which are supposed to be\nillustrative, but soon were used to perform limited testing. R itself is\nusing the same package structure and it was clear early that a test\nsuite is important and so was introduced. Consequently, the same\nfacilities were available to packages, but only very few were using it.\nThere are, however, no built-in tools for creating test suites. In core\nR those are hand-curated by experienced developers, but that does not\nscale to package space.\nOver 18,000 packages are now present in the Comprehensive R Archive\nNetwork (CRAN), a repository which has arguably played major role in the\nsuccess of R (Hornik and Leisch\n2002). This is not only a valuable resource for users, but\ntoday this rich collection of contributed R code in being used as an\nautomated test-suite for R. This is no coincidence, the importance of\nsoftware engineering concepts has been identified by the CRAN team long\ntime ago and the tools in R have been enhanced for that purpose (Hornik 2016). CRAN has been an\ninvaluable asset for the development of R based on examples and limited\ntests alone. It allows us the R Core Team to test changes in R against\ncode that was written by ingenious people that do not necessarily follow\ndocumentation, but instead write code that seems to work - possibly in\nways not intended in the first place. Consequently, improving the\nquality and coverage of tests in packages has not only positive impact\non the individual package, but on the quality of the entire CRAN\necosystem and R itself.\nCRAN performs reverse-dependency checks where packages are not\nallowed to break dependent package which is an important software\nengineering concept. One can see CRAN as performing continuous\nintegration and continuous testing if we consider all submitted packages\nas one big project. This is not universally liked among package authors,\nthough. Some find it too tedious to be responsible for software in the\nway a software engineer would be - a concern which is also highlighted\nby the article.\nSteal and Borrow\nOne perhaps surprising finding of the article was the analysis of\ncode fragment re-use (Claes et al. 2015). A\nquite recent example how dangerous such practice is was a piece of badly\nwritten JavaScript code from Stack Overflow (StackOverflow) which was copied so often\nthat it made it into the popular Unity game engine, effectively forcing\nbrowsers to lie about macOS versions (Chromium Bugs) just to not break\nmillions of released products. R code fragments are less likely to have\nsuch world-wide impact, but can be equally frustrating. The historically\nrelatively high cost of loading other packages was an incentive to\nsimply copy fragments instead, but the performance impact has been\ndiminishing with advancements in the R implementation. Still, I believe\nthe exact reasons for fragment re-use deserve further examination and\nmay reveal other, more benign motives.\nEvery Project Needs a\nConductor\nAnother good example of introducing software engineering principles\ninto the R world successfully is the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al. 2004). The authors\nrealized early that the project is too big for it to allow organic\ngrowth and have strongly encouraged the use of the S4 class system to\nbuild a class hierarchy specific to the tasks common to the Bioconductor\npackages. This enabled optimizations of implementation as a core part of\nthe system as opposed to individual approaches in each package.\nBioconductor was also encouraging unit tests and has maintained a build\nand reporting system similar to that of CRAN, in the early days even\npioneering functionality that was later added to core R.\nThe Gospel of Data Science\nI believe the Call to Action is a very timely contribution. Many R\nusers start as statisticians or data analysts in some domain since that\nis the main strength of R. Consequently, a lot of R code is never\npublicly visible. Code written for data analyses is not software\ndevelopment and is not published as software. So any global statistics\nabout R code have to be taken with that in mind. When considering R\npackages we are talking only about a fraction of the code written in R.\nHowever, building new tools is an important part of the R ecosystem and\nit has to be made clear that it is different from data analysis and thus\nrequires different skills and tools.\nThe main realization here is that at some point an R user may become\nan R developer, crossing the line from analysis into software\nengineering. And we are often unprepared for that, in part because of\nour diverse background. When I asked my junior colleagues at the Labs\nwhat they find most challenging yet valuable, the top item was learning\nsoftware engineering skills on the job. We were lucky to have both the\nauthors of S as well as the authors of Unix on the same floor, so we\nwere able to bridge the gap, but generally our schools don’t prepare for\nthat. That’s why I believe we must teach statistical computing together\nwith software engineering skills such as re-usability and testing\nconcepts. The current popularity of data science which bridges both\nworlds is a good excuse to make it actually happen in practice.\n\nCRAN packages used\ndata.table, RJava, reticulate\nCRAN\nTask Views implied by cited packages\nFinance, HighPerformanceComputing,\nModelDeployment,\nNumericalMathematics,\nTimeSeries\n\n\nR.

The future package implements the Future API for programming with futures in R. This minimal API provides sufficient constructs for implementing parallel versions of well-established, high-level map-reduce APIs. The future ecosystem supports exception handling, output and condition relaying, parallel random number generation, and automatic identification of globals lowering the threshold to parallelize code. The Future API bridges parallel frontends with parallel backends, following the philosophy that end-users are the ones who choose the parallel backend while the developer focuses on what to parallelize. A variety of backends exist, and third-party contributions meeting the specifications, which ensure that the same code works on all backends, are automatically supported. The future framework solves several problems not addressed by other parallel frameworks in R.",

    "description": "The number of packages/software for Gaussian State Space models has increased over recent decades. However, there are very few codes available for non-Gaussian State Space (NGSS) models due to analytical intractability that prevents exact calculations. One of the few tractable exceptions is the family of NGSS with exact marginal likelihood, named NGSSEML. In this work, we present the wide range of data formats and distributions handled by NGSSEML and a package in the R language to perform classical and Bayesian inference for them. Special functions for filtering, forecasting, and smoothing procedures and the exact calculation of the marginal likelihood function are provided. The methods implemented in the package are illustrated for count and volatility time series and some reliability/survival models, showing that the codes are easy to handle. Therefore, the NGSSEML family emerges as a simple and interesting option/alternative for modeling non-Gaussian time-varying structures commonly encountered in time series and reliability/survival studies.

    "title": "Robust and Efficient Optimization Using a Marquardt-Levenberg Algorithm with R Package marqLevAlg",
    "description": "Implementations in R of classical general-purpose algorithms for local optimization generally have two major limitations which cause difficulties in applications to complex problems: too loose convergence criteria and too long calculation time. By relying on a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (MLA), a Newton-like method particularly robust for solving local optimization problems, we provide with marqLevAlg package an efficient and general-purpose local optimizer which (i) prevents con vergence to saddle points by using a stringent convergence criterion based on the relative distance to minimum/maximum in addition to the stability of the parameters and of the objective function; and (ii) reduces the computation time in complex settings by allowing parallel calculations at each iteration. We demonstrate through a variety of cases from the literature that our implementation reli ably and consistently reaches the optimum (even when other optimizers fail) and also largely reduces computational time in complex settings through the example of maximum likelihood estimation of different sophisticated statistical models.",

    "description": "Convenient and easy-to-use programs are readily available in R to simulate data from and probability calculations for several common multivariate distributions such as normal and t. However, functions for doing so from other less common multivariate distributions, especially those which are asymmetric, are not as readily available, either in R or otherwise. We introduce the R package NonNorMvtDist to generate random numbers from multivariate Lomax distribution, which constitutes a very flexible family of skewed multivariate distributions. Further, by applying certain useful properties of multivariate Lomax distribution, multivariate cases of generalized Lomax, Mardia’s Pareto of Type I, Logistic, Burr, Cook-Johnson’s uniform, F, and inverted beta can be also considered, and random numbers from these distributions can be generated. Methods for the probability and the equicoordinate quantile calculations for all these distributions are then provided. This work substantially enriches the existing R toolbox for nonnormal or nonsymmetric multivariate probability distributions.",

Unlike existing packages, the cat.dt package represents the CAT in a Decision Tree (DT) structure. This allows building the test before its administration, ensuring that the creation time of the test is independent of the number of participants. Moreover, to accelerate the construction of the tree, the package controls its growth by joining nodes with similar estimations or distributions of the ability level and uses techniques such as message passing and pre-calculations. The constructed tree, as well as the estimation procedure, can be visualized using the graphical tools included in the package. An experiment designed to evaluate its performance shows that the cat.dt package drastically reduces computational time in the creation of CATs without compromising accuracy.",

It is especially useful when the data is heterogeneous or heavy-tailed.

    "description": "Marginal methods have been widely used for analyzing longitudinal ordinal data due to their simplicity in model assumptions, robustness in inference results, and easiness in the implementation. However, they are often inapplicable in the presence of measurement errors in the variables. Under the setup of longitudinal studies with ordinal responses and covariates subject to misclassification, Chen et al. (2014) developed marginal methods for misclassification adjustments using the second-order estimating equations and proposed a two-stage estimation approach when the validation subsample is available. Parameter estimation is conducted through the Newton-Raphson algorithm, and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators is established. While the methods of Chen et al. (2014) can successfully correct the misclassification effects, its implementation is not accessible to general users due to the lack of a software package. In this paper, we develop an R package, mgee2, to implement the marginal methods proposed by Chen et al. (2014). To evaluate the performance and illustrate the features of the package, we conduct numerical studies.",

In particular, at statistical agencies, the respondent-level data they collect from surveys and censuses can suffer from high rates of missingness. Furthermore, agencies are obliged to protect respondents’ privacy when publishing the collected data for public use. The NPBayesImputeCat R package, introduced in this paper, provides routines to i) create multiple imputations for missing data and ii) create synthetic data for statistical disclosure control, for multivariate categorical data, with or without structural zeros. We describe the Dirichlet process mixture of products of the multinomial distributions model used in the package and illustrate various uses of the package using data samples from the American Community Survey (ACS). We also compare results of the missing data imputation to the mice R package and those of the synthetic data generation to the synthpop R package.",

Concretely, the inclusion of individuals that were already at risk before the effective initiation in a cohort study may cause the unawareness of prior episodes that have already been experienced, and this will easily lead to biased and inefficient estimates. The miRecSurv package is based on the use of models with specific baseline hazard, with multiple imputation of the number of prior episodes when unknown by means of the COMPoisson distribution, a very flexible count distribution that can handle over, sub, and equidispersion, with a stratified model depending on whether the individual had or had not previously been at risk, and the use of a frailty term. The usage of the package is illustrated by means of a real data example based on an occupational cohort study and a simulation study.",

For single-winner elections, STV is also called Instant Runoff Voting (IRV), Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), or the alternative vote (AV) system. The package also implements the STV system with equal preferences, for the first time in a software package, to our knowledge. It also implements a new variant of STV, in which a minimum number of candidates from a specified group are required to be elected. We illustrate the package with several real examples.",

    "title": "Estimating Social Influence Effects in Networks Using A Latent Space Adjusted Approach in R ",
    "description": "Social influence effects have been extensively studied in various empirical network research. However, many challenges remain in estimating social influence effects in networks, as influence effects are often entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process and the common social-environmental factors that individuals are embedded in. Methods currently available either do not solve these problems or require stringent assumptions. Recent works by Xu (2018) and others have shown that a latent space adjusted approach based on the latent space model has the potential to disentangle the influence effects from other processes, and the simulation evidence has shown that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recovering the true social influence effect when there is an unobserved trait co-determining influence and selection. In this paper, I will further illustrate how the latent space adjusted approach can account for bias in the estimation of social influence effects and how this approach can be easily implemented in R.",

    "description": "Multi-state models are a useful way of describing a process in which an individual moves through a number of finite states in continuous time. The illness-death model plays a central role in the theory and practice of these models, describing the dynamics of healthy subjects who may move to an intermediate \"diseased\" state before entering into a terminal absorbing state. In these models, one important goal is the modeling of transition rates which is usually done by studying the relationship between covariates and disease evolution. However, biomedical researchers are also interested in reporting other interpretable results in a simple and summarized manner. These include estimates of predictive probabilities, such as the transition probabilities, occupation probabilities, cumulative incidence functions, and the sojourn time distributions. The development of survidm package has been motivated by recent contribution that provides answers to all these topics. An illustration of the software usage is included using real data.",

When the individuals are divided into T groups, the R package dad associates with each group a multivariate probability density function and then carries out these techniques on the densities, which are estimated by the data under consideration. These techniques are based on distance measures between densities: chi-square, Hellinger, Jeffreys, Jensen-Shannon, and L p for discrete densities, Hellinger , Jeffreys, L2 , and 2-Wasserstein for Gaussian densities, and L2 for numeric non-Gaussian densities estimated by the Gaussian kernel method. Practical methods help the user to give meaning to the outputs in the context of MDS and HCA and to look for an optimal prediction in the context of DA based on the one-leave-out misclassification ratio. Some functions for data management or basic statistics calculations on groups are annexed.",

    "description": "Balancing the distributions of the confounders across the exposure levels in an observational study through matching or weighting is an accepted method to control for confounding due to these variables when estimating the association between an exposure and outcome and reducing the degree of dependence on certain modeling assumptions. Despite the increasing popularity in practice, these procedures cannot be immediately applied to datasets with missing values. Multiple imputation of the missing data is a popular approach to account for missing values while preserving the number of units in the dataset and accounting for the uncertainty in the missing values. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive matching and weighting software that can be easily implemented with multiply imputed datasets. In this paper, we review this problem and suggest a framework to map out the matching and weighting of multiply imputed datasets to 5 actions as well as the best practices to assess balance in these datasets after matching and weighting. We also illustrate these approaches using a companion package for R, MatchThem.",

Moreover, the CompModels package is especially well suited for the sequential optimization of computer models. The package is a mix of real-world physics problems, known mathematical functions, and black-box functions that have been converted into computer models with the goal of Bayesian (i.e., sequential) optimization in mind. Likewise, the package contains computer models that represent either the constrained or unconstrained optimization case, each with varying levels of difficulty. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the package with both real-world examples and black-box functions by solving constrained optimization problems via Bayesian optimization. Ultimately, the package is shown to provide users with a source of computer model test functions that are reproducible, shareable, and that can be used for benchmarking of novel optimization methods.",

    "description": "In the last years, big data has become a useful paradigm for taking advantage of multiple sources to find relevant knowledge in real domains (such as the design of personalized marketing campaigns or helping to palliate the effects of several fatal diseases). Big data programming tools and methods have evolved over time from a MapReduce to a pipeline-based archetype. Concretely the use of pipelining schemes has become the most reliable way of processing and analyzing large amounts of data. To this end, this work introduces bdpar, a new highly customizable pipeline-based framework (using the OOP paradigm provided by [R6](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6) package) able to execute multiple preprocessing tasks over heterogeneous data sources. Moreover, to increase the flexibility and performance, bdpar provides helpful features such as (i) the definition of a novel object-based pipe operator ( %\\>\\|%), (ii) the ability to easily design and deploy new (and customized) input data parsers, tasks, and pipelines, (iii) only-once execution which avoids the execution of previously processed information (instances), guaranteeing that only new both input data and pipelines are executed, (iv) the capability to perform serial or parallel operations according to the user needs, (v) the inclusion of a debugging mechanism which allows users to check the status of each instance (and find possible errors) throughout the process.",

    "description": "During the building of a genome-scale metabolic model, there are several dead-end metabo lites and substrates which cannot be imported, produced, nor used by any reaction incorporated in the network. The presence of these dead-end metabolites can block out the net flux of the objective function when it is evaluated through Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and when it is not blocked, bias in the biological conclusions increase. In this aspect, the refinement to restore the connectivity of the network can be carried out manually or using computational algorithms. The g2f package was designed as a tool to find the gaps from dead-end metabolites and fill them from the stoichiometric reactions of a reference, filtering candidate reactions using a weighting function. Additionally, this algorithm allows downloading all the sets of gene-associated stoichiometric reactions for a specific organism from the KEGG database. Our package is compatible with both 4.0.0 and 3.6.0 R versions.",

Approximate moment estimators of the parameters of the distribution, to be used as starting values for numerical opti mization procedures, are discussed. “Exact” moment estimation, effected via a numerical procedure, and maximum likelihood estimation, are considered. The quality of the results produced by these estimators is assessed via simulation experiments. Several examples are given of fitting instances of the new distribution to real and simulated data. It is noted that the new distribution is a member of the exponential family. Expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood of the new distribution are derived. The former facilitates the numerical maximization of the likelihood with optim(); the latter provides means of calculating or estimating the covariance matrix of of the parame ter estimates. A discrepancy between estimates of the covariance matrix obtained by inverting the Hessian and those obtained by Monte Carlo methods is discussed.",

    "description": "Survival data often include a fraction of units that are susceptible to an event of interest as well as a fraction of \"immune\" units. In many applications, spatial clustering in unobserved risk factors across nearby units can also affect their survival rates and odds of becoming immune. To address these methodological challenges, this article introduces our [BayesSPsurv](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BayesSPsurv) R-package, which fits parametric Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure) models that can account for spatial autocorrelation in both subpopulations of the user's time-to-event data. Spatial autocorrelation is modeled with spatially weighted frailties, which are estimated using a conditionally autoregressive prior. The user can also fit parametric cure models with or without nonspatial i.i.d. frailties, and each model can incorporate time-varying covariates. BayesSPsurv also includes various functions to conduct pre-estimation spatial autocorrelation tests, visualize results, and assess model performance, all of which are illustrated using data on post-civil war peace survival.",

    "description": "This paper introduces the package ROCnReg that allows estimating the pooled ROC curve, the covariate-specific ROC curve, and the covariate-adjusted ROC curve by different methods, both from (semi) parametric and nonparametric perspectives and within Bayesian and frequentist paradigms. From the estimated ROC curve (pooled, covariate-specific, or covariate-adjusted), several summary measures of discriminatory accuracy, such as the (partial) area under the ROC curve and the Youden index, can be obtained. The package also provides functions to obtain ROC-based optimal threshold values using several criteria, namely, the Youden index criterion and the criterion that sets a target value for the false positive fraction. For the Bayesian methods, we provide tools for assessing model fit via posterior predictive checks, while the model choice can be carried out via several information criteria. Numerical and graphical outputs are provided for all methods. This is the only package implementing Bayesian procedures for ROC curves.",

    "description": "It is often useful to tap information from a running R script. Obvious use cases include monitoring the consumption of resources (time, memory) and logging. Perhaps less obvious cases include tracking changes in R objects or collecting the output of unit tests. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach that abstracts the collection and processing of such secondary information from the running R script. Our approach is based on a combination of three elements. The first element is to build a customized way to evaluate code. The second is labeled *local masking* and it involves temporarily masking a user-facing function so an alternative version of it is called. The third element we label *local side effect*. This refers to the fact that the masking function exports information to the secondary information flow without altering a global state. The result is a method for building systems in pure R that lets users create and control secondary flows of information with minimal impact on their workflow and no global side effects.",

Quasi Maximum Likelihood (QML) methods ensure estimates are consistent and standard errors valid, even when the standardized innovations are non-normal or dependent, or both. Zero-coefficient restrictions by omission enable parsimonious specifications, and functions to facilitate the non-standard inference associated with zero-restrictions in the null-hypothesis are provided.

    "description": "The last decades show an increased interest in modeling various types of data through copulae. Different copula models have been developed, which lead to the challenge of finding the best fitting model for a particular dataset. From the other side, a strand of literature developed a list of different Goodness-of-Fit (GoF) tests with different powers under different conditions. The usual practice is the selection of the best copula via the $p$-value of the GoF test. Although this method is not purely correct due to the fact that non-rejection does not imply acception, this strategy is favored by practitioners. Unfortunately, different GoF tests often provide contradicting outputs. The proposed R-package brings under one umbrella 13 most used copulae - plus their rotated variants - together with 16 GoF tests and a hybrid one. The package offers flexible margin modeling, automatized parallelization, parameter estimation, as well as a user-friendly interface, and pleasant visualizations of the results. To illustrate the functionality of the package, two exemplary applications are provided.",

    "description": "Optimal propensity score matching has emerged as one of the most ubiquitous approaches for causal inference studies on observational data. However, outstanding critiques of the statistical properties of propensity score matching have cast doubt on the statistical efficiency of this technique, and the poor scalability of optimal matching to large data sets makes this approach inconvenient if not infeasible for sample sizes that are increasingly commonplace in modern observational data. The [stratamatch](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stratamatch) package provides implementation support and diagnostics for 'stratified matching designs,' an approach that addresses both of these issues with optimal propensity score matching for large-sample observational studies. First, stratifying the data enables more computationally efficient matching of large data sets. Second, stratamatch implements a 'pilot design' approach in order to stratify by a prognostic score, which may increase the precision of the effect estimate and increase power in sensitivity analyses of unmeasured confounding.",

In survival analysis, cure models are a useful tool when a fraction of the population is likely to be immune from the event of interest. They can separate the effects of certain factors on the probability of being susceptible and on the time until the occurrence of the event. Moreover, the penPHcure package allows the user to simulate data from a PH cure model, where the event-times are generated on a continuous scale from a piecewise exponential distribution conditional on time-varying covariates, with a method similar to @Hendry_2014. We present the results of a simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the methodology and illustrate the functionalities of the penPHcure package using criminal recidivism data.",

The basics of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and all its variants are formally introduced step-by-step from the simplest auto-recurrence to the most advanced multivariate case. Importantly, we show how such RQA methods can be deployed under a single computational framework in R using a substantially renewed version of our crqa 2.0 package. This package includes implementations of several recent advances in recurrence-based analysis, among them applications to multivariate data and improved entropy calculations for categorical data. We show concrete applications of our package to example data, together with a detailed description of its functions and some guidelines on their usage.",

Despite these advantages, the available versions impose some limitations for research studies in mountain watersheds dominated by ice-snow melt runoff (i.e., no glacier module, a limited number of elevation bands, among other constraints). Here we present HBV.IANIGLA, a tool for hydroclimatic studies in regions with steep topography and/or cryospheric processes which provides a modular and extended implementation of the HBV model as an R package. To our knowledge, this is the first modular version of the original HBV model.

Direct estimation of statistical indicators, for instance, poverty and inequality indicators, is facilitated by a non parametric kernel density algorithm. The algorithm is able to account for weights in the estimation of statistical indicators. The standard errors of the statistical indicators are estimated with a non parametric bootstrap. Furthermore, the package offers statistical methods for the estimation of linear and linear mixed regression models with an interval-censored dependent variable, particularly random slope and random intercept models. Parameter estimates are obtained through a stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm. Standard errors are estimated using a non parametric bootstrap in the linear regression model and by a parametric bootstrap in the linear mixed regression model. To handle departures from the model assumptions, fixed (logarithmic) and data-driven (Box-Cox) transformations are incorporated into the algorithm.",

    "description": "R package [krippendorffsalpha](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=krippendorffsalpha) provides tools for measuring agreement using Krippendorff's $\\alpha$ coefficient, a well-known nonparametric measure of agreement (also called inter-rater reliability and various other names). This article first develops Krippendorff's $\\alpha$ in a natural way and situates $\\alpha$ among statistical procedures. Then, the usage of package [krippendorffsalpha](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=krippendorffsalpha) is illustrated via analyses of two datasets, the latter of which was collected during an imaging study of hip cartilage. The package permits users to apply the $\\alpha$ methodology using built-in distance functions for the nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio levels of measurement. User-defined distance functions are also supported. The fitting function can accommodate any number of units, any number of coders, and missingness. Bootstrap inference is supported, and the bootstrap computation can be carried out in parallel.",

    "description": "It is common to come across SAS or Stata manuals while working on academic empirical finance research. Nonetheless, given the popularity of open-source programming languages such as R, there are fewer resources in R covering popular databases such as CRSP and COMPUSTAT. The aim of this article is to bridge the gap and illustrate how to leverage R in working with both datasets. As an application, we illustrate how to form size-value portfolios with respect to [@fama1993common] and study the sensitivity of the results with respect to different inputs. Ultimately, the purpose of the article is to advocate reproducible finance research and contribute to the recent idea of \"Open Source Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing\", proposed by @chen2020open.",

    "description": "The need to analyze the dependence between two or more point processes in time appears in many modeling problems related to the occurrence of events, such as the occurrence of climate events at different spatial locations or synchrony detection in spike train analysis. The package IndTestPP provides a general framework for all the steps in this type of analysis, and one of its main features is the implementation of three families of tests to study independence given the intensities of the processes, which are not only useful to assess independence but also to identify factors causing dependence. The package also includes functions for generating different types of dependent point processes, and implements computational statistical inference tools using them. An application to characterize the dependence between the occurrence of extreme heat events in three Spanish locations using the package is shown.",

The nesting of categorical variables produces a hierarchical structure. The [tsibbletalk](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tsibbletalk) package is developed to allow a user to interactively explore temporal data, relative to the nested or crossed structures.

    "description": "The conveyance of clinical trial explorations and analysis results from a statistician to a clinical investigator is a critical component of the drug development and clinical research cycle. Automating the process of generating documents for data descriptions, summaries, exploration, and analysis allows the statistician to provide a more comprehensive view of the information captured by a clinical trial, and efficient generation of these documents allows the statistican to focus more on the conceptual development of a trial or trial analysis and less on the implementation of the summaries and results on which decisions are made. This paper explores the use of the listdown package for automating reproducible documents in clinical trials that facilitate the collaboration between statisticians and clinicians as well as defining an analysis pipeline for document generation.",

The package enables us to fit CCA to large-$p$ and small-$n$ data. The paper provides a complete guide. Also, the seeded CCA application results are compared with the regularized CCA in the existing R package.

They assume that a subgroup of the individuals under study will never experience the event (cured subjects). So, the goal is twofold: to study both the cure probability and the failure time of the uncured individuals through a proper survival function (latency). The R package npcure implements a completely nonparametric approach for estimating these functions in mixture cure models, considering right-censored survival times. Nonparametric estimators for the cure probability and the latency as functions of a covariate are provided. Bootstrap bandwidth selectors for the estimators are included. The package also implements a nonparametric covariate significance test for the cure probability, which can be applied with a continuous, discrete, or qualitative covariate.",

The procedure uses a Bayesian hierarchical model to assimilate multiple types of data coming from multiple sites considered as similar to the target site. This prior summarizes the information contained in the data in the form of a probability density function that can be used to better inform further geostatistical investigations at the site. The formulation of the prior uses ex-situ data, where the data set can either be gathered by the user or come in the form of a structured database. The package is designed to be flexible in that regard. For illustration purposes and for easiness of use, the package is ready to be used with the worldwide hydrogeological parameter database (WWHYPDA) [@Comunian2009].",

Specifically, the Dionysus, GUDHI, and Ripser libraries have been wrapped by the **TDA** and **TDAstats** CRAN packages. These software represent powerful analysis tools that are computationally expensive and, to our knowledge, have not been formally benchmarked. Here, we analyze runtime and memory growth for the 2 R packages and the 3 underlying libraries. We find that datasets with less than 3 dimensions can be evaluated with persistent homology fastest by the GUDHI library in the **TDA** package. For higher-dimensional datasets, the Ripser library in the TDAstats package is the fastest. Ripser and **TDAstats** are also the most memory-efficient tools to calculate persistent homology.",

    "description": "The R package [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) for Statistical Quality Control (SQC) is introduced and described. It includes a comprehensive set of univariate and multivariate SQC tools that completes and increases the SQC techniques available in R. Apart from integrating different R packages devoted to SQC ([qcc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcc), [MSQC](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MSQC)), [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) provides nonparametric tools that are highly useful when Gaussian assumption is not met. This package computes standard univariate control charts for individual measurements, $\\bar{x}$, $S$, $R$, $p$, $np$, $c$, $u$, EWMA, and CUSUM. In addition, it includes functions to perform multivariate control charts such as Hotelling T$^2$, MEWMA and MCUSUM. As representative features, multivariate nonparametric alternatives based on data depth are implemented in this package: $r$, $Q$ and $S$ control charts. The [qcr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=qcr) library also estimates the most complete set of capability indices from first to the fourth generation, covering the nonparametric alternatives, and performing the corresponding capability analysis graphical outputs, including the process capability plots. Moreover, Phase I and II control charts for functional data are included.",

    "description": "This paper introduces [pdynmc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pdynmc), an R package that provides users sufficient flexibility and precise control over the estimation and inference in linear dynamic panel data models. The package primarily allows for the inclusion of nonlinear moment conditions and the use of iterated GMM; additionally, visualizations for data structure and estimation results are provided. The current implementation reflects recent developments in literature, uses sensible argument defaults, and aligns commercial and noncommercial estimation commands. Since the understanding of the model assumptions is vital for setting up plausible estimation routines, we provide a broad introduction of linear dynamic panel data models directed towards practitioners before concisely describing the functionality available in pdynmc regarding instrument type, covariate type, estimation methodology, and general configuration. We then demonstrate the functionality by revisiting the popular firm-level dataset of @AreBon1991.",

    "description": "Chaos theory has been hailed as a revolution of thoughts and attracting ever-increasing attention of many scientists from diverse disciplines. Chaotic systems are non-linear deterministic dynamic systems which can behave like an erratic and apparently random motion. A relevant field inside chaos theory is the detection of chaotic behavior from empirical time-series data. One of the main features of chaos is the well-known initial-value sensitivity property. Methods and techniques related to testing the hypothesis of chaos try to quantify the initial-value sensitive property estimating the so-called Lyapunov exponents. This paper describes the main estimation methods of the Lyapunov exponent from time series data. At the same time, we present the DChaos library. R users may compute the delayed-coordinate embedding vector from time series data, estimates the best-fitted neural net model from the delayed-coordinate embedding vectors, calculates analytically the partial derivatives from the chosen neural nets model. They can also obtain the neural net estimator of the Lyapunov exponent from the partial derivatives computed previously by two different procedures and four ways of subsampling by blocks. To sum up, the DChaos package allows the R users to test robustly the hypothesis of chaos in order to know if the data-generating process behind time series behaves chaotically or not. The package's functionality is illustrated by examples.",

Each of the many normalization techniques that have been developed has its own strengths and weaknesses, and deciding which to use until data are fully observed is difficult or impossible. This package facilitates choosing between a range of possible transformations and will automatically return the best one, i.e., the one that makes data look the *most* normal. To evaluate and compare the normalization efficacy across a suite of possible transformations, we developed a statistic based on a goodness of fit test divided by its degrees of freedom. Transformations can be seamlessly trained and applied to newly observed data and can be implemented in conjunction with caret and recipes for data preprocessing in machine learning workflows. Custom transformations and normalization statistics are supported.",

Its asymptotic properties are well-understood thanks to the large body of literature about this estimator. The introduced weights allow for the inclusion of sampling weights, trimming, and efficient estimation under heteroscedasticity. Further options facilitate easy handling of aggregated data, prediction, and the presentation of estimation results.

For instance, Earth Sciences and archaeology exploit luminescence as a dating method. Herein, we present the R package [RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) implementing sets of luminescence models to be simulated with Monte Carlo (MC) methods. MC methods make a powerful ally to all kinds of simulation attempts involving stochastic processes. Luminescence production is such a stochastic process in the form of charge (electron-hole pairs) interaction within insulators and semiconductors. To simulate luminescence-signal curves, we distribute single and independent MC processes to virtual MC clusters. [RLumCarlo](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RLumCarlo) comes with a modularized design and consistent user interface: (1) C++ functions represent the modeling core and implement models for specific stimulations modes. (2) R functions give access to combinations of models and stimulation modes, start the simulation and render terminal and graphical feedback. The combination of MC clusters supports the simulation of complex luminescence phenomena.",

Specifically, the NTS package covers the implementation of threshold autoregressive (TAR) models, autoregressive conditional mean models with exogenous variables (ACMx), functional autoregressive models, and state-space models. Users can also evaluate and compare the performance of different models and select the best one for prediction. Furthermore, the package implements flexible and comprehensive sequential Monte Carlo methods (also known as particle filters) for modeling non-Gaussian or nonlinear processes. Several examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the NTS package.",

    "title": "MoTBFs: An R Package for Learning Hybrid Bayesian Networks Using Mixtures of Truncated Basis Functions",
    "description": "This paper introduces MoTBFs, an R package for manipulating mixtures of truncated basis functions. This class of functions allows the representation of joint probability distributions involving discrete and continuous variables simultaneously, and includes mixtures of truncated exponentials and mixtures of polynomials as special cases. The package implements functions for learning the parameters of univariate, multivariate, and conditional distributions, and provides support for parameter learning in Bayesian networks with both discrete and continuous variables. Probabilistic inference using forward sampling is also implemented. Part of the functionality of the MoTBFs package relies on the bnlearn package, which includes functions for learning the structure of a Bayesian network from a data set. Leveraging this functionality, the MoTBFs package supports learning of MoTBF-based Bayesian networks over hybrid domains. We give a brief introduction to the methodological context and algorithms implemented in the package. An extensive illustrative example is used to describe the package, its functionality, and its usage.",

    "title": "Analyzing Basket Trials under Multisource Exchangeability Assumptions",
    "description": "Basket designs are prospective clinical trials that are devised with the hypothesis that the presence of selected molecular features determine a patient’s subsequent response to a particular “targeted” treatment strategy. Basket trials are designed to enroll multiple clinical subpopulations to which it is assumed that the therapy in question offers beneficial efficacy in the presence of the targeted molecular profile. The treatment, however, may not offer acceptable efficacy to all subpopulations enrolled. Moreover, for rare disease settings, such as oncology wherein these trials have become popular, marginal measures of statistical evidence are difficult to interpret for sparsely enrolled subpopulations. Consequently, basket trials pose challenges to the traditional paradigm for trial design, which assumes inter-patient exchangeability. The package basket for the R programmming environment (R Core Team, 2019) facilitates the analysis of basket trials by implementing multi source exchangeability models. By evaluating all possible pairwise exchangeability relationships, this hierarchical modeling framework facilitates Bayesian posterior shrinkage among a collection of discrete and pre-specified subpopulations. Analysis functions are provided to implement posterior inference of the response rates and all possible exchangeability relationships between subpopulations. In addition, the package can identify “poolable” subsets of and report their response characteristics. The functionality of the package is demonstrated using data from an oncology study with subpopulations defined by tumor histology.

Because of the enormous amount of data this represents, the continuous updates and improvements in spatial and temporal resolution and category differentiation, as well as increasingly dynamic and complex changes made, manual data extraction and analysis is highly time consuming, and making software tools available to automatize LUC data assessment is becom ing imperative. This paper presents a software developed in R, which combines LUC raster time series data and their transitions, calculates state-of-the-art LUC change indicators, and creates spatio temporal visualizations, all in a coherent workflow. The functionality of the application developed is demonstrated using an LUC dataset of the Pantanal floodplain contribution area in Central Brazil.",

    "description": "We provide a publicly available library FarmTest in the R programming system. This library implements a factor-adjusted robust multiple testing principle proposed by Fan et al. (2019) for large-scale simultaneous inference on mean effects. We use a multi-factor model to explicitly capture the dependence among a large pool of variables. Three types of factors are considered: observable, latent, and a mixture of observable and latent factors. The non-factor case, which corresponds to standard multiple mean testing under weak dependence, is also included. The library implements a series of adaptive Huber methods integrated with fast data-driven tuning schemes to estimate model parameters and to construct test statistics that are robust against heavy-tailed and asymmetric error distributions. Extensions to two-sample multiple mean testing problems are also discussed. The results of some simulation experiments and a real data analysis are reported.",

    "title": "User-Specified General-to-Specific and Indicator Saturation Methods",
    "description": "General-to-Specific (GETS) modelling provides a comprehensive, systematic and cumulative approach to modelling that is ideally suited for conditional forecasting and counterfactual analysis, whereas Indicator Saturation (ISAT) is a powerful and flexible approach to the detection and estimation of structural breaks (e.g. changes in parameters), and to the detection of outliers. To these ends, multi path backwards elimination, single and multiple hypothesis tests on the coefficients, diagnostics tests and goodness-of-fit measures are combined to produce a parsimonious final model. In many situations a specific model or estimator is needed, a specific set of diagnostics tests may be required, or a specific fit criterion is preferred. In these situations, if the combination of estimator/model, diagnostics tests and fit criterion is not offered in a pre-programmed way by publicly available software, then the implementation of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods puts a large programming-burden on the user. Generic functions and procedures that facilitate the implementation of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods for specific problems can therefore be of great benefit. The R package gets is the first software – both inside and outside the R universe – to provide a complete set of facilities for user-specified GETS and ISAT methods: User-specified model/estimator, user-specified diagnostics and user-specified goodness-of-fit criteria. The aim of this article is to illustrate how user-specified GETS and ISAT methods can be implemented with the R package gets.",

    "description": "Penalized regression models such as the lasso have been extensively applied to analyzing high-dimensional data sets. However, due to memory limitations, existing R packages like glmnet and ncvreg are not capable of fitting lasso-type models for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that are increasingly seen in many areas such as genetics, genomics, biomedical imaging, and high-frequency finance. In this research, we implement an R package called biglasso that tackles this challenge. biglasso utilizes memory-mapped files to store the massive data on the disk, only reading data into memory when necessary during model fitting, and is thus able to handle out-of core computation seamlessly. Moreover, it’s equipped with newly proposed, more efficient feature screening rules, which substantially accelerate the computation. Benchmarking experiments show that our biglasso package, as compared to existing popular ones like glmnet, is much more memory and computation-efficient. We further analyze a 36 GB simulated GWAS data set on a laptop with only 16 GB RAM to demonstrate the out-of-core computation capability of biglasso in analyzing massive data sets that cannot be accommodated by existing R packages.",

However, when the hazard functions cross, tests in existing R packages do not perform well. To address the issue, we introduce the package survELtest, which provides tests for comparing multiple survival functions with possibly crossing hazards. Due to its powerful likelihood ratio formulation, this is the only R package to date that works when the hazard functions cross. We illustrate the use of the procedures in survELtest by applying them to data from randomized clinical trials and simulated datasets. We show that these methods lead to more significant results than those obtained by existing R packages.",

While it is demonstrated that the complexity of Shiny applications is limited by the background architecture, and real security concerns exist for novice app developers, the collaborative benefits are worth attention from the wider research community. Shiny simplifies the use of complex methodologies for people of different specialities, at the level of proficiency appropriate for the end user. This enables a diverse community of users to interact efficiently, and utilise cutting edge methodologies. The literature reviewed demonstrates that complex methodologies can be put into practice without insisting on investment in professional training, for a comprehensive understanding from all participants. It appears that Shiny opens up concurrent benefits in communication between those who analyse data and other disciplines, that would enrich much of the peer-reviewed research.",

To simplify the process, the puzzle R package has been developed aimed at simplifying and facilitating the time consuming and error prone task of assembling pharmacometrics datasets. Puzzle consist of a series of functions written in R. These functions create, from tabulated files, datasets that are compatible with the formatting requirements of the gold standard non-linear mixed effects modeling software. With only one function, puzzle(), complex pharmacometrics databases can easily be assembled. Users are able to select from different absorption processes such as zeroand first-order, or a com bination of both. Furthermore, datasets containing data from one or more analytes, and/or one or more responses, and/or time dependent and/or independent covariates, and/or urine data can be simultaneously assembled. The puzzle package is a powerful and efficient tool that helps modelers, programmers and pharmacometricians through the challenging process of assembling pharmacometrics datasets.",

In this study, an extensive Monte-Carlo simulation study is conducted to investigate the performance of the the tests for equality of normal distributed group means under unequal variances in terms of Type I error probability and penalized power. In the case of Type I error probability of the compared tests are different, the penalized power is used which allows fair power comparisons. In this way, we conclude the performance of the tests by taking into account two possible errors in hypothesis testing.",

    "title": "A Fast and Scalable Implementation Method for Competing Risks Data with the R Package fastcmprsk",
    "description": "Advancements in medical informatics tools and high-throughput biological experimentation make large-scale biomedical data routinely accessible to researchers. Competing risks data are typical in biomedical studies where individuals are at risk to more than one cause (type of event) which can preclude the others from happening. The Fine and Gray (1999) proportional subdistribution hazards model is a popular and well-appreciated model for competing risks data and is currently implemented in a number of statistical software packages. However, current implementations are not computation ally scalable for large-scale competing risks data. We have developed an R package, fastcmprsk, that uses a novel forward-backward scan algorithm to significantly reduce the computational complexity for parameter estimation by exploiting the structure of the subject-specific risk sets. Numerical studies compare the speed and scalability of our implementation to current methods for unpenalized and penalized Fine-Gray regression and show impressive gains in computational efficiency.",

    "title": "ordinalClust: An R Package to Analyze Ordinal Data",
    "description": "Ordinal data are used in many domains, especially when measurements are collected from people through observations, tests, or questionnaires. ordinalClust is an innovative R package dedicated to ordinal data that provides tools for modeling, clustering, co-clustering and classifying such data. Ordinal data are modeled using the BOS distribution, which is a model with two meaningful parameters referred to as \"position\" and \"precision\". The former indicates the mode of the distribution and the latter describes how scattered the data are around the mode: the user is able to easily interpret the distribution of their data when given these two parameters. The package is based on the co clustering framework (when rows and columns are simultaneously clustered). The co-clustering approach uses the Latent Block Model (LBM) and the SEM-Gibbs algorithm for parameter inference. On the other hand, the clustering and the classification methods follow on from simplified versions of the SEM-Gibbs algorithm. For the classification process, two approaches are proposed. In the first one, the BOS parameters are estimated from the training dataset in the conventional way. In the second approach, parsimony is introduced by estimating the parameters and column-clusters from the training dataset. We empirically show that this approach can yield better results. For the clustering and co-clustering processes, the ICL-BIC criterion is used for model selection purposes. An overview of these methods is given, and the way to use them with the ordinalClust package is described using real datasets. The latest stable package version is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

    "description": "Kernel semi-parametric models and their equivalence with linear mixed models provide analysts with the flexibility of machine learning methods and a foundation for inference and tests of hypothesis. These models are not impacted by the number of predictor variables, since the kernel trick transforms them to a kernel matrix whose size only depends on the number of subjects. Hence, methods based on this model are appealing and numerous, however only a few R programs are available and none includes a complete set of features. Here, we present the KSPM package to fit the kernel semi-parametric model and its extensions in a unified framework. KSPM allows multiple kernels and unlimited interactions in the same model. It also includes predictions, statistical tests, variable selection procedure and graphical tools for diagnostics and interpretation of variable effects. Currently KSPM is implemented for continuous dependent variables but could be extended to binary or survival outcomes.",

    "description": "The demand for precise data for analytical purposes grows rapidly among the research community and decision makers as more geographic information is being collected. Laws protecting data privacy are being enforced to prevent data disclosure. Statistical institutes and agencies need methods to preserve confidentiality while maintaining accuracy when disclosing geographic data. In this paper we present the AQuadtree package, a software intended to produce and deal with official spatial data making data privacy and accuracy compatible. The lack of specific methods in R to anonymize spatial data motivated the development of this package, providing an automatic aggregation tool to anonymize point data. We propose a methodology based on hierarchical geographic data structures to create a varying size grid adapted to local area population densities. This article gives insights and hints for implementation and usage. We hope this new tool may be helpful for statistical offices and users of official spatial data.",

The data analyzed is a set/mixture of continuous and correlated components/chemicals that are reasonable to combine in an index and share a common outcome. These components are also interval-censored between zero and upper thresholds, or detection limits, which may differ among the components. This type of data is found in areas such as chemical epidemiological studies, sociology, and genomics. The miWQS package can be run using complete or incomplete data, which may be placed in the first quantile, or imputed using bootstrap or Bayesian approach.

    "description": "Dynamic low-dimensional linear projections of multivariate data collectively known as tours provide an important tool for exploring multivariate data and models. The R package tourr provides functions for several types of tours: grand, guided, little, local and frozen. Each of these can be viewed dynamically, or saved into a data object for animation. This paper describes a new package, spinifex, which provides a manual tour of multivariate data where the projection coefficient of a single variable is controlled. The variable is rotated fully into the projection, or completely out of the projection. The resulting sequence of projections can be displayed as an animation, with functions from either the plotly or gganimate packages. By varying the coefficient of a single variable, it is possible to explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to that variable. This is particularly useful when used with a projection pursuit guided tour to simplify and understand the solution. The use of the manual tour is applied particle physics data to illustrate the sensitivity of structure in a projection to specific variable contributions.",

It is a set of tools for simulation of these processes as well as performing statistical inference and simulation studies on them. We introduce: tools that we developed to work with that type of motions as well as methods and ideas underlying them. Also we perform numerical experiments to show finite-sample behavior of certain estimators of the integral, and give an idea of how to envelope workflow related to the linear fractional stable motion in S4 classes and methods.

    "description": "The g-and-k and (generalised) g-and-h distributions are flexible univariate distributions which can model highly skewed or heavy tailed data through only four parameters: location and scale, and two shape parameters influencing the skewness and kurtosis. These distributions have the unusual property that they are defined through their quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function) and their density is unavailable in closed form, which makes parameter inference complicated. This paper presents the gk R package to work with these distributions. It provides the usual distribution functions and several algorithms for inference of independent identically distributed data, including the finite difference stochastic approximation method, which has not been used before for this problem.",

    "description": "With the current emphasis on reproducibility and replicability, there is an increasing need to examine how data analyses are conducted. In order to analyze the between researcher variability in data analysis choices as well as the aspects within the data analysis pipeline that contribute to the variability in results, we have created two R packages: matahari and tidycode. These packages build on methods created for natural language processing; rather than allowing for the processing of natural language, we focus on R code as the substrate of interest. The matahari package facilitates the logging of everything that is typed in the R console or in an R script in a tidy data frame. The tidycode package contains tools to allow for analyzing R calls in a tidy manner. We demonstrate the utility of these packages as well as walk through two examples.",

The purpose of the package rcosmo is to conduct efficient information processing, visualisation, manipulation and spatial statistical analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation and other spherical data. The package was developed for spherical data stored in the Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (Healpix) representation. rcosmo has more than 100 different functions. Most of them initially were developed for CMB, but also can be used for other spherical data as rcosmo contains tools for transforming spherical data in cartesian and geographic coordinates into the HEALPix representation.

In the current paper, we describe implementation of the main functions of the difNLR package, from data generation, through the model fitting and hypothesis testing, to graphical representation of the results.

The R package NonProbEst enables the estimation of parameters using some of these techniques to correct selection bias in non-probability surveys. The mean and the total of the target variable are estimated using Propensity Score Adjustment, calibration, statistical matching, model-based, model-assisted and model-calibratated techniques. Confidence intervals can also obtained for each method. Machine learning algorithms can be used for estimating the propensities or for predicting the unknown values of the target variable for the non-sampled units. Variance of a given estimator is performed by two different Leave-One-Out jackknife procedures. The functionality of the package is illustrated with example data sets.",

In this article, we present a theoretical description of methods from the NlinTS package, and we focus on causality measures. The package contains the classical Granger causality test. To handle non-linear time series, we propose an extension of this test using an artificial neural network. The package includes an implementation of the Transfer entropy, which is also considered as a non linear causality measure based on information theory. For discrete variables, we use the classical Shannon Transfer entropy, while for continuous variables, we adopt the k-nearest neighbors approach to estimate it.",

    "description": "Third-party software for assuring source code quality is becoming increasingly popular. Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests, perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use are crucial in the software development life cycle. More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses of large software repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design patterns applied by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful measure of similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code. We demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in a real-world case study.",

    "description": "High-dimensional variable selection in the proportional hazards (PH) model has many successful applications in different areas. In practice, data may involve confounding variables that do not satisfy the PH assumption, in which case the stratified proportional hazards (SPH) model can be adopted to control the confounding effects by stratification without directly modeling the confounding effects. However, there is a lack of computationally efficient statistical software for high-dimensional variable selection in the SPH model. In this work an R package, SurvBoost, is developed to implement the gradient boosting algorithm for fitting the SPH model with high-dimensional covariate variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that in many scenarios SurvBoost can achieve better selection accuracy and reduce computational time substantially compared to the existing R package that implements boosting algorithms without stratification. The proposed R package is also illustrated by an analysis of gene expression data with survival outcome in The Cancer Genome Atlas study. In addition, a detailed hands-on tutorial for SurvBoost is provided.",

One difficulty with this skew-t family is that the elements of the expected information matrix do not have closed form analytic formulas. Thus, we developed a numerical integration method of computing the expected information matrix in the R package skewtInfo. The accuracy of our expected information matrix calculation method was confirmed by comparing the result with that obtained using an observed information matrix for a very large sample size. A Monte Carlo study to evaluate the accuracy of the standard errors obtained with our expected information matrix calculation method, for the case of three realistic skew-t parameter vectors, indicates that use of the expected information matrix results in standard errors as accurate as, and sometimes a little more accurate than, use of an observed information matrix.",

    "description": "Data subject to length-biased sampling are frequently encountered in various applications including prevalent cohort studies and are considered as a special case of left-truncated data under the stationarity assumption. Many semiparametric regression methods have been proposed for length biased data to model the association between covariates and the survival outcome of interest. In this paper, we present a brief review of the statistical methodologies established for the analysis of length-biased data under the Cox model, which is the most commonly adopted semiparametric model, and introduce an R package CoxPhLb that implements these methods. Specifically, the package includes features such as fitting the Cox model to explore covariate effects on survival times and checking the proportional hazards model assumptions and the stationarity assumption. We illustrate usage of the package with a simulated data example and a real dataset, the Channing House data, which are publicly available.",

    "description": "Bivariate time-to-event data frequently arise in research areas such as clinical trials and epidemiological studies, where the occurrence of two events are correlated. In many cases, the exact event times are unknown due to censoring. The copula model is a popular approach for modeling correlated bivariate censored data, in which the two marginal distributions and the between margin dependence are modeled separately. This article presents the R package CopulaCenR, which is designed for modeling and testing bivariate data under right or (general) interval censoring in a regression setting. It provides a variety of Archimedean copula functions including a flexible two-parameter copula and different types of regression models (parametric and semiparametric) for marginal distributions. In particular, it implements a semiparametric transformation model for the margins with proportional hazards and proportional odds models being its special cases. The numerical optimization is based on a novel two-step algorithm. For the regression parameters, three likelihood-based tests (Wald, generalized score and likelihood ratio tests) are also provided. We use two real data examples to illustrate the key functions in CopulaCenR.",

    "description": "BayesMallows is an R package for analyzing preference data in the form of rankings with the Mallows rank model, and its finite mixture extension, in a Bayesian framework. The model is grounded on the idea that the probability density of an observed ranking decreases exponentially with the distance to the location parameter. It is the first Bayesian implementation that allows wide choices of distances, and it works well with a large amount of items to be ranked. BayesMallows handles non-standard data: partial rankings and pairwise comparisons, even in cases including non-transitive preference patterns. The Bayesian paradigm allows coherent quantification of posterior uncertainties of estimates of any quantity of interest. These posteriors are fully available to the user, and the package comes with convienient tools for summarizing and visualizing the posterior distributions.",

    "title": "S, R, and Data Science",
    "description": "Data science is increasingly important and challenging. It requires computational tools and programming environments that handle big data and difficult computations, while supporting creative, high-quality analysis. The R language and related software play a major role in computing for data science. R is featured in most programs for training in the field. R packages provide tools for a wide range of purposes and users. The description of a new technique, particularly from research in statistics, is frequently accompanied by an R package, greatly increasing the usefulness of the description. The history of R makes clear its connection to data science. R was consciously designed to replicate in open-source software the contents of the S software. S in turn was written by data analysis researchers at Bell Labs as part of the computing environment for research in data analysis and collaborations to apply that research, rather than as a separate project to create a programming language. The features of S and the design decisions made for it need to be understood in this broader context of supporting effective data analysis (which would now be called data science). These characteristics were all transferred to R and remain central to its effectiveness. Thus, R can be viewed as based historically on a domain-specific language for the domain of data science. Note to R Journal readers: The following paper was published online in the History of Programming Languages (HOPL), Volume 4, in June 2020 (DOI 10.1145/3386334). The content seems likely to be of interest to many R Journal readers, and since HOPL is plausibly not typical reading for data scientists, the editors of the R Journal have kindly offered to republish the paper here. This is possible thanks also to the enlightened policy of the ACM, providing for open distribution through the chosen copyright declaration.",

Estimation and mapping methods are implemented for continuous, discrete, and right-censored survival data.

    "description": "Item response theory (IRT) models for unfolding processes use the responses of individuals to attitudinal tests or questionnaires in order to infer item and person parameters located on a latent continuum. Parametric models in this class use parametric functions to model the response process, which in practice can be restrictive. MUDFOLD (Multiple UniDimensional unFOLDing) can be used to obtain estimates of person and item ranks without imposing strict parametric assumptions on the item response functions (IRFs). This paper describes the implementation of the MUDFOLD method for binary preferential-choice data in the R package mudfold. The latter incorporates estimation, visualization, and simulation methods in order to provide R users with utilities for nonparametric analysis of attitudinal questionnaire data. After a brief introduction in IRT, we provide the method ological framework implemented in the package. A description of the available functions is followed by practical examples and suggestions on how this method can be used even outside the field of psychometrics.",

Common examples include regressions based on splines, wavelets, and piecewise polynomials. This article discusses the main methodological and numerical features of the R software package lspartition, which implements results for partitioning-based least squares (series) regression estimation and inference from Cattaneo and Farrell (2013) and Cattaneo, Farrell, and Feng (2020). These results cover the multivariate regression function as well as its derivatives. First, the package provides data-driven methods to choose the number of partition knots optimally, according to integrated mean squared error, yielding optimal point estimation. Second, robust bias correction is implemented to combine this point estimator with valid inference. Third, the package provides estimates and inference for the unknown function both pointwise and uniformly in the conditioning variables. In particular, valid confidence bands are provided. Finally, an extension to two-sample analysis is developed, which can be used in treatment-control comparisons and related problems.",

This model relies on a set of assumptions that, when not satisfied, yields biased results and noisy estimates. A common problem that can be solved in many ways – use of less restrictive methods (e.g. generalized linear regression models or non-parametric methods ), variance corrections or transformations of the response variable just to name a few. We focus on the latter option as it allows to keep using the simple and well-known linear regression model. The list of transformations proposed in the literature is long and varies according to the problem they aim to solve. Such diversity can leave analysts lost and confused. We provide a framework implemented as an R-package, trafo, to help select suitable transformations depending on the user requirements and data being analyzed. The package trafo contains a collection of selected transformations and estimation methods that complement and increase the breadth of methods that exist in R.",

The conceptual heterogeneity of fixed coupon bonds traded in the global markets imposes a high degree of complexity on their comparative analysis. Contrary to baseline fixed income theory, in practice, most bonds feature coupon period irregularities. In addition, there are a multitude of day count methods that determine the interest accrual, the cash flows and the discount factors used in bond valuation. Several R packages, e.g., fBonds, RQuantLib, and YieldCurve, provide tools for fixed income analysis. Nevertheless, none of them is capable of evaluating bonds featuring irregular first and/or final coupon periods, and neither provides adequate coverage of day count conventions currently used in the global bond markets. The R package BondValuation closes this gap using the generalized valuation methodology presented in Djatschenko (2019).",

We provide a new R package, biclustermd, which allows users to perform biclustering on numeric data even in the presence of missing values.",

    "title": "PPCI: an R Package for Cluster Identification using Projection Pursuit",
    "description": "This paper presents the R package PPCI which implements three recently proposed projec tion pursuit methods for clustering. The methods are unified by the approach of defining an optimal hyperplane to separate clusters, and deriving a projection index whose optimiser is the vector normal to this separating hyperplane. Divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms that can detect clusters defined in different subspaces are readily obtained by recursively bi-partitioning the data through such hyperplanes. Projecting onto the vector normal to the optimal hyperplane enables visualisations of the data that can be used to validate the partition at each level of the cluster hierarchy. Clustering models can also be modified in an interactive manner to improve their solutions. Extensions to problems involving clusters which are not linearly separable, and to the problem of finding maximum hard margin hyperplanes for clustering are also discussed.",

    "description": "Several methods for creating classifiers based on rules discovered via association rule mining have been proposed in the literature. These classifiers are called associative classifiers and the best-known algorithm is Classification Based on Associations (CBA). Interestingly, only very few implementations are available and, until recently, no implementation was available for R. Now, three packages provide CBA. This paper introduces associative classification, the CBA algorithm, and how it can be used in R. A comparison of the three packages is provided to give the potential user an idea about the advantages of each of the implementations. We also show how the packages are related to the existing infrastructure for association rule mining already available in R.",

While existing approaches that rely on specific distributional assumptions of the data (multivariate normality and/or equal covariance matrices) are implemented in statistical software packages, there is a need for user-friendly software that can be used for the analysis of data that do not fulfill the aforementioned assumptions and provide accurate p value and confidence interval estimates. Therefore, newly developed nonpara metric statistical methods based on bootstrapand permutation-approaches, which neither assume multivariate normality nor specific covariance matrices, have been implemented in the freely available R package MANOVA.RM. The package is equipped with a graphical user interface for plausible applications in academia and other educational purpose. Several motivating examples illustrate the application of the methods.",

Because it is estimated using only the observed durations’ rank ordering, typical quantities of interest used to communicate results of the Cox model come from the hazard function (e.g., hazard ratios or percentage changes in the hazard rate). These quantities are substantively vague and difficult for many audiences of research to understand. We introduce a suite of methods in the R package coxed to address these problems. The package allows researchers to calculate duration-based quantities from Cox model results, such as the expected duration (or survival time) given covariate values and marginal changes in duration for a specified change in a covariate. These duration-based quantities often match better with researchers’ substantive interests and are easily understood by most readers. We describe the methods and illustrate use of the package.",

    "description": "Spatial statistics for infectious diseases are important because the spatial and temporal scale over which transmission operates determine the dynamics of disease spread. Many methods for quantifying the distribution and clustering of spatial point patterns have been developed (e.g. K function and pair correlation function) and are routinely applied to infectious disease case occurrence data. However, these methods do not explicitly account for overlapping chains of transmission and require knowledge of the underlying population distribution, which can be limiting when analyzing epidemic case occurrence data. Therefore, we developed two novel spatial statistics that account for these effects to estimate: 1) the mean of the spatial transmission kernel, and 2) the τ-statistic, a measure of global clustering based on pathogen subtype. We briefly introduce these statistics and show how to implement them using the IDSpatialStats R package.",

    "description": "Ranked set sampling (RSS) is an advanced data collection method when the exact mea surement of an observation is difficult and/or expensive used in a number of research areas, e.g., environment, bioinformatics, ecology, etc. In this method, random sets are drawn from a population and the units in sets are ranked with a ranking mechanism which is based on a visual inspection or a concomitant variable. Because of the importance of working with a good design and easy analysis, there is a need for a software tool which provides sampling designs and statistical inferences based on RSS and its modifications. This paper introduces an R package as a free and easy-to-use analysis tool for both sampling processes and statistical inferences based on RSS and its modified versions. For researchers, the RSSampling package provides a sample with RSS, extreme RSS, median RSS, percentile RSS, balanced groups RSS, double versions of RSS, L-RSS, truncation-based RSS, and robust extreme RSS when the judgment rankings are both perfect and imperfect. Researchers can also use this new package to make parametric inferences for the population mean and the variance where the sample is obtained via classical RSS. Moreover, this package includes applications of the nonparametric methods which are one sample sign test, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test procedures. The package is available as RSSampling on CRAN.",

The unival package’s implementation comes from a series of procedures put forward by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2019) and new methodological developments proposed in this article. We assess models fitted using unival by means of a simulation study extending the results obtained in the original proposal. Its usefulness is also assessed through a real-world data example.

This program is also applicable to the situation of two evenly spaced time series not on the same time grid. BINCOR is based on a novel estimation approach proposed by Mudelsee (2010) for estimating the correlation between two climate time series with different timescales. The idea is that autocorrelation (e.g. an AR1 process) means that memory enables values obtained on different time points to be correlated. Binned correlation is performed by resampling the time series under study into time bins on a regular grid, assigning the mean values of the variable under scrutiny within those bins. We present two examples of our BINCOR package with real data: instrumental and paleoclimatic time series. In both applications BINCOR works properly in detecting well-established relationships between the climate records compared.",

The examination is carried out by diagnostic scores and visual verification. The code presented in this paper are implemented in the auditor package. Its flexible and consistent grammar facilitates the validation models of a large class of models.",

    "title": "shadow: R Package for Geometric Shadow Calculations in an Urban Environment",
    "description": "This paper introduces the shadow package for R. The package provides functions for shadow related calculations in the urban environment, namely shadow height, shadow footprint and Sky View Factor (SVF) calculations, as well as a wrapper function to estimate solar radiation while taking shadow effects into account. All functions operate on a layer of polygons with a height attribute, also known as “extruded polygons” or 2.5D vector data. Such data are associated with accuracy limitations in representing urban environments. However, unlike 3D models, polygonal layers of building outlines along with their height are abundantly available and their processing does not require specialized closed-source 3D software. The present package thus brings spatio-temporal shadow, SVF and solar radiation calculation capabilities to the open-source spatial analysis workflow in R. Package functionality is demonstrated using small reproducible examples for each function. Wider potential use cases include urban environment applications such as evaluation of micro-climatic influence for urban planning, studying urban climatic comfort and estimating photovoltaic energy production potential.",

    "description": "High-throughput genomic technologies bring to light a comprehensive hallmark of molecular changes of a disease. It is increasingly evident that genes are not isolated from each other and the identification of a gene signature can only partially elucidate the de-regulated biological functions in a disease. The comprehension of how groups of genes (pathways) are related to each other (pathway cross talk) could explain biological mechanisms causing diseases. Biological pathways are important tools to identify gene interactions and decrease the large number of genes to be studied by partitioning them into smaller groups. Furthermore, recent scientific studies have demonstrated that an integration of pathways and networks, instead of a single component of the pathway or a single network, could lead to a deeper understanding of the pathology. StarBioTrek is an R package for the integration of biological pathways and networks which provides a series of functions to support the user in their analyses. In particular, it implements algorithms to identify pathways cross-talk networks and gene network drivers in pathways. It is available as open source and open development software in the Bioconductor platform.",

Unlike post-model-selection confidence intervals, the confidence interval that utilizes uncertain prior information (CIUUPI) implemented in this package has, to an excellent approximation, coverage probability throughout the parameter space that is very close to the desired minimum coverage probability. Furthermore, when the uncertain prior information is correct, the CIUUPI is, on average, shorter than the standard confidence interval constructed using the full linear regression model. In this paper we provide motivating examples of scenarios where the CIUUPI may be used. We then give a detailed description of this interval and the numerical constrained optimization method implemented in R to obtain it. Lastly, using a real data set as an illustrative example, we show how to use the functions in ciuupi.",

    "title": "cvcrand: A Package for Covariate-constrained Randomization and the Clustered Permutation Test for Cluster Randomized Trials",
    "description": "The cluster randomized trial (CRT) is a randomized controlled trial in which randomization is conducted at the cluster level (e.g., school or hospital) and outcomes are measured for each individual within a cluster. Often, the number of clusters available to randomize is small (≤ 20), which increases the chance of baseline covariate imbalance between comparison arms. Such imbalance is particularly problematic when the covariates are predictive of the outcome because it can threaten the internal validity of the CRT. Pair-matching and stratification are two restricted randomization approaches that are frequently used to ensure balance at the design stage. An alternative, less commonly-used restricted randomization approach is covariate-constrained randomization. Covariate-constrained randomization quantifies baseline imbalance of cluster-level covariates using a balance metric and randomly selects a randomization scheme from those with acceptable balance by the balance metric. It is able to accommodate multiple covariates, both categorical and continuous. To facilitate imple mentation of covariate-constrained randomization for the design of two-arm parallel CRTs, we have developed the cvcrand R package. In addition, cvcrand also implements the clustered permutation test for analyzing continuous and binary outcomes collected from a CRT designed with covariate constrained randomization. We used a real cluster randomized trial to illustrate the functions included in the package.",

When the data to be imputed are correlated or have a multilevel structure — repeated observations on patients, school children nested in classes within schools within educational districts — the imputation model needs to include this structure. Here we introduce our joint modelling package for multiple imputation of multilevel data, jomo, which uses a multivariate normal model fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Compared to previous packages for multilevel imputation, e.g. pan, jomo adds the facility to (i) handle and impute categorical variables using a latent normal structure, (ii) impute level-2 variables, and (iii) allow for cluster-specific covariance matrices, including the option to give them an inverse-Wishart distribution at level 2. The package uses C routines to speed up the computations and has been extensively validated in simulation studies both by ourselves and others.",

    "description": "Though longitudinal data often contain missing responses and error-prone covariates, relatively little work has been available to simultaneously correct for the effects of response missingness and covariate measurement error on analysis of longitudinal data. Yi (2008) proposed a simulation based marginal method to adjust for the bias induced by measurement error in covariates as well as by missingness in response. The proposed method focuses on modeling the marginal mean and variance structures, and the missing at random mechanism is assumed. Furthermore, the distribution of covariates are left unspecified. These features make the proposed method applicable to a broad settings. In this paper, we develop an R package, called swgee, which implements the method proposed by Yi (2008). Moreover, our package includes additional implementation steps which extend the setting considered by Yi (2008). To describe the use of the package and its main features, we report simulation studies and analyses of a data set arising from the Framingham Heart Study.",

MDFS is an implementation of an algorithm based on information theory (Mnich and Rudnicki, 2017). The computational kernel of the package is implemented in C++. A high-performance version implemented in CUDA C is also available. The application of MDFS is demonstrated using the well-known Madelon dataset, in which a decision variable is generated from synergistic interactions between descriptor variables. It is shown that the application of multidimen sional analysis results in better sensitivity and ranking of importance.",

    "description": "The SimCorrMix package generates correlated continuous (normal, non-normal, and mix ture), binary, ordinal, and count (regular and zero-inflated, Poisson and Negative Binomial) variables that mimic real-world data sets. Continuous variables are simulated using either Fleishman’s third order or Headrick’s fifth-order power method transformation. Simulation occurs at the component level for continuous mixture distributions, and the target correlation matrix is specified in terms of correlations with components. However, the package contains functions to approximate expected correlations with continuous mixture variables. There are two simulation pathways which calculate intermediate correlations involving count variables differently, increasing accuracy under a wide range of parameters. The package also provides functions to calculate cumulants of continuous mixture distributions, check parameter inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and summarize and plot simulated variables. SimCorrMix is an important addition to existing R simulation packages because it is the first to include continuous mixture and zero-inflated count variables in correlated data sets.",

    "title": "Time-Series Clustering in R Using the dtwclust Package",
    "description": "Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably since their initial definition. The common improvements are either related to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or the function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic Time Warping distance being particularly popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of shape-based time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and associated techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering procedures.",

    "description": "Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are useful to model continuous stochastic processes. When (independent) repeated temporal data are available, variability between the trajectories can be modeled by introducing random effects in the drift of the SDEs. These models are useful to analyze neuronal data, crack length data, pharmacokinetics, financial data, to cite some applications among other. The R package focuses on the estimation of SDEs with linear random effects in the drift. The goal is to estimate the common density of the random effects from repeated discrete observations of the SDE. The package mixedsde proposes three estimation methods: a Bayesian parametric, a frequentist parametric and a frequentist nonparametric method. The three procedures are described as well as the main functions of the package. Illustrations are presented on simulated and real data.",

    "description": "Methods based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting are in the forefront among several techniques being proposed for indoor positioning. This paper introduces the R package ipft, which provides algorithms and utility functions for indoor positioning using fingerprinting techniques. These functions are designed for manipulation of RSSI fingerprint data sets, estimation of positions, comparison of the performance of different positioning models, and graphical visualization of data. Well-known machine learning algorithms are implemented in this package to perform analysis and estimations over RSSI data sets. The paper provides a description of these algorithms and functions, as well as examples of its use with real data. The ipft package provides a base that we hope to grow into a comprehensive library of fingerprinting-based indoor positioning methodologies.",

    "title": "RobustGaSP: Robust Gaussian Stochastic Process Emulation in R",
    "description": "Gaussian stochastic process (GaSP) emulation is a powerful tool for approximating compu tationally intensive computer models. However, estimation of parameters in the GaSP emulator is a challenging task. No closed-form estimator is available and many numerical problems arise with standard estimates, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator. In this package, we implement a marginal posterior mode estimator, for special priors and parameterizations. This estimation method that meets the robust parameter estimation criteria was discussed in Gu et al. (2018); mathematical reasons are provided therein to explain why robust parameter estimation can greatly improve predictive performance of the emulator. In addition, inert inputs (inputs that almost have no effect on the variability of a function) can be identified from the marginal posterior mode estimation at no extra computational cost. The package also implements the parallel partial Gaussian stochastic process (PP GaSP) emulator (Gu and Berger (2016)) for the scenario where the computer model has multiple outputs on, for example, spatial-temporal coordinates. The package can be operated in a default mode, but also allows numerous user specifications, such as the capability of specifying trend functions and noise terms. Examples are studied herein to highlight the performance of the package in terms of out-of-sample prediction.",

    "description": "Intensive longitudinal data in the behavioral sciences are often noisy, multivariate in nature, and may involve multiple units undergoing regime switches by showing discontinuities interspersed with continuous dynamics. Despite increasing interest in using linear and nonlinear differential/difference equation models with regime switches, there has been a scarcity of software packages that are fast and freely accessible. We have created an R package called dynr that can handle a broad class of linear and nonlinear discreteand continuous-time models, with regime-switching properties and linear Gaussian measurement functions, in C, while maintaining simple and easy-to learn model specification functions in R. We present the mathematical and computational bases used by the dynr R package, and present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the unique features of dynr.",

In the current version, all the functions are rewritten in the C++ language allowing their application in large-size problems. Moreover, new fuzzy relational clustering algorithms for partitioning qualitative/mixed data are provided together with an improved version of the so-called Gustafson-Kessel algorithm to avoid singularity in the cluster covariance matrices. Finally, it is now possible to automatically select the number of clusters by means of the available fuzzy cluster validity indices.",

The package provides functions for obtaining a matched dataset along with estimates of most common parameters of interest and model-based standard errors. A propensity score matching analysis, relating math proficiency with homework completion for students belonging to different schools (based on the NELS-88 data), illustrates in detail the use of the algorithms.",

    "description": "The 4 Parameter Logistic (4PL) model has been recognized as a major tool to analyze the relationship between doses and responses in pharmacological experiments. A main strength of this model is that each parameter contributes an intuitive meaning enhancing interpretability of a fitted model. However, implementing the 4PL model using conventional statistical software often encounters numerical errors. This paper highlights the issue of convergence failure and presents several causes with solutions. These causes include outliers and a non-logistic data shape, so useful remedies such as robust estimation, outlier diagnostics and constrained optimization are proposed. These features are implemented in a new R package dr4pl (Dose-Response analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic model) whose code examples are presented as a separate section. Our R package dr4pl is shown to work well for data sets where the traditional dose-response modelling packages drc and nplr fail.",

However, interventions are often implemented without a randomized control group for practical or ethical reasons. Propensity score matching (PSM) is a popular method for minimizing the effects of a randomized experiment from observational data by matching members of a treatment group to similar candidates that did not receive the intervention. Traditional PSM is not designed for studies that enroll participants on a rolling basis and does not provide a solution for interventions in which the baseline and intervention period are undefined in the comparison group. Rolling Entry Matching (REM) is a new matching method that addresses both issues. REM selects comparison members who are similar to intervention members with respect to both static (e.g., race) and dynamic (e.g., health conditions) characteristics. This paper will discuss the key components of REM and introduce the rollmatch R package.",

    "title": "Modeling regimes with extremes: the bayesdfa package for identifying and forecasting common trends and anomalies in multivariate time-series data",
    "description": "The bayesdfa package provides a flexible Bayesian modeling framework for applying dy namic factor analysis (DFA) to multivariate time-series data as a dimension reduction tool. The core estimation is done with the Stan probabilistic programming language. In addition to being one of the few Bayesian implementations of DFA, novel features of this model include (1) optionally modeling latent process deviations as drawn from a Student-t distribution to better model extremes, and (2) optionally including autoregressive and moving-average components in the latent trends. Besides estimation, we provide a series of plotting functions to visualize trends, loadings, and model pre dicted values. A secondary analysis for some applications is to identify regimes in latent trends. We provide a flexible Bayesian implementation of a Hidden Markov Model — also written with Stan — to characterize regime shifts in latent processes. We provide simulation testing and details on parameter sensitivities in supplementary information.",

    "title": "Optimization Routines for Enforcing One-to-One Matches in Record Linkage Problems",
    "description": "Record linkage aims at quickly and accurately identifying if two records represent the same real world entity. In many applications, we are interested in restricting the linkage results to \"1 to 1\" links, that is a single record does not appear more than once in the output. This can be dealt with the transport algorithm. The optimization problem, however, grows quadratically in the size of the input, quickly becoming untreatable for cases with a few thousand records. This paper compares different solutions, provided by some R packages for linear programming solvers. The comparison is done in terms of memory usage and execution time. The aim is to overcome the current implementation in the toolkit RELAIS, specifically developed for record linkage problems. The results highlight improvements beyond expectations. In fact the tested solutions allow successfully executing the \"1 to 1\" reduction for large size datasets up to the largest sample surveys at National Statistical Institutes.",

    "title": "Using Web Services to Work with Geodata in R",
    "description": "Through collaborative mapping, a massive amount of data is accessible. Many individuals contribute information each day. The growing amount of geodata is gathered by volunteers or obtained via crowd-sourcing. One outstanding example of this is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Project which provides access to big data in geography. Another online mapping service that enables the integration of geodata into the analysis is Google Maps. The expanding content and the availability of geographic information radically changes the perspective on geodata (Chilton 2009). Recently many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been built on OSM and Google Maps. That leads to a point where it is possible to access sections of geographical information without the usage of a complex database solution, especially if one only requires a small data section for a visualization. First tools for spatial analysis have been included in the R language very early (Bivand and Gebhardt, 2000) and this development will continue to accelerate, underpinning a continual change. Notably, in recent years many tools have been developed to enable the usage of R as a geographic information system (GIS). With a GIS it is possible to process spatial data. QuantumGIS (QGIS) is a free software solution for these tasks, and a user interface is available for this purpose. R is, therefore, an alternative to geographic information systems like QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). Besides, add-ins for QGIS and R-packages (RQGIS) are available, that enables the combination of R and QGIS (Muenchow and Schratz 2017). It is the target of this article to present some of the most important R-functionalities to download and process geodata from OSM and the Google Maps API. The focus of this paper is on functions that enable the natural usage of these APIs.",

We have developed a new R package called idmTPreg to estimate regression coefficients in datasets that can be described by the progressive illness-death model. The motivation for the development of the package is a recent contribution that enables the estimation of possibly time-varying covariate effects on the transition probabilities for a progressive illness-death data. The main feature of the package is that it befits both non-Markov and Markov progressive illness-death data. The package implements the introduced estimators obtained using a direct binomial regression approach. Also, variance estimates and confidence bands are implemented in the package.

Furthermore, the application aspires to be an easy-to-use tool for analysis of educational tests by allowing the users to upload and analyze their own data and to automatically generate analysis reports in PDF or HTML. We argue that psychometric analysis should be a routine part of test development in order to gather proofs of reliability and validity of the measurement, and we demonstrate how ShinyItemAnalysis may help enforce this goal.",

BETS provides not only thousands of Brazilian economic time series from different institutions, but also a range of analytical tools, and educational resources. In particular, BETS is capable of generating automated model reports for any given time series. These reports rely on a single function call and are able to build three types of models (SARIMA being one of them). The functions need few inputs and output rich content. The output varies according to the inputs and usually consists of a summary of the series properties, step-by-step explanations on how the model was developed, predictions made by the model, and a file containing these predictions. This work focuses on this feature and several other BETS functions that are designed to help in modeling time series. We present them in a thorough case study: the SARIMA approach to model and forecast the Brazilian production of intermediate goods index series.",

The stplanr package facilitates common transport planning tasks including: downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating geographic “desire lines” from origin-destination (OD) data; route assignment, locally and interfaces to routing services such as CycleStreets.net; calculation of route segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate flow; and ‘travel watershed’ analysis. This paper demonstrates this functionality using reproducible examples on real transport datasets. More broadly, the experience of developing and using R functions for transport applications shows that open source software can form the basis of a reproducible transport planning workflow. The stplanr package, alongside other packages and open source projects, could provide a more transparent and democratically accountable alternative to the current approach, which is heavily reliant on proprietary and relatively inaccessible software.",

    "description": "The increase in life expectancy followed by the burden of chronic diseases contributes to disability at older ages. The estimation of how much chronic conditions contribute to disability can be useful to develop public health strategies to reduce the burden. This paper introduces the R package addhaz, which is based on the attribution method (Nusselder and Looman, 2004) to partition disability into the additive contributions of diseases using cross-sectional data. The R package includes tools to fit the additive hazard model, the core of the attribution method, to binary and multinomial outcomes. The models are fitted by maximizing the binomial and multinomial log-likelihood functions using constrained optimization. Wald and bootstrap confidence intervals can be obtained for the parameter estimates. Also, the contribution of diseases to the disability prevalence and their bootstrap confidence intervals can be estimated. An additional feature is the possibility to use parallel computing to obtain the bootstrap confidence intervals. In this manuscript, we illustrate the use of addhaz with several examples for the binomial and multinomial models, using the data from the Brazilian National Health Survey, 2013.",

    "description": "Complex networks are used to describe a broad range of disparate social systems and natural phenomena, from power grids to customer segmentation to human brain connectome. Challenges of parametric model specification and validation inspire a search for more data-driven and flexible nonparametric approaches for inference of complex networks. In this paper we discuss methodology and R implementation of two bootstrap procedures on random networks, that is, patchwork bootstrap of Thompson et al. (2016) and Gel et al. (2017) and vertex bootstrap of Snijders and Borgatti (1999). To our knowledge, the new R package snowboot is the first implementation of the vertex and patchwork bootstrap inference on networks in R. Our new package is accompanied with a detailed user’s manual, and is compatible with the popular R package on network studies igraph. We evaluate the patchwork bootstrap and vertex bootstrap with extensive simulation studies and illustrate their utility in an application to analysis of real world networks.",

    "description": "This article introduces testforDEP, a portmanteau R package implementing for the first time several modern tests and visualization tools for independence between two variables. While classical tests for independence are in the base R packages, there have been several recently developed tests for independence that are not available in R. This new package combines the classical tests including Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient method, Kendall’s τ rank correlation coefficient method and Spearman’s ρ rank correlation coefficient method with modern tests consisting of an empirical likelihood based test, a density-based empirical likelihood ratio test, Kallenberg data driven test, maximal information coefficient test, Hoeffding’s independence test and the continuous analysis of variance test. For two input vectors of observations, the function testforDEP provides a common interface for each of the tests and returns test statistics, corresponding p values and bootstrap confidence intervals as output. The function AUK provides an interface to visualize Kendall plots and computes the area under the Kendall plot similar to computing the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.",

The algorithm searches a data space for models of a user-specified form that are statistically optimal under a measure of model quality. Many iterations afford a set of feasible solutions (or candidate models) that the researcher can evaluate for relevance to his or her questions of interest. The algorithm can be used to formulate new or to improve upon existing models in bioinformatics, health care, and myriad other fields in which the volume of available data has outstripped researchers’ practical and computational ability to explore larger subsets or higher-order interaction terms. The package accommodates linear and generalized linear models, as well as a variety of criterion functions such as Allen’s PRESS and AIC. New modeling strategies and criterion functions can be adapted easily to work with rFSA.",

Originally designed for military applications, this technique applies to any spatial point process where there is a desire to clearly understand the measurement of density and maintain fidelity of the point locations. Typical spatial density plotting algorithms, such as kernel density estimation, implement some type of smoothing function that often results in a density value that is difficult to interpret. The purpose of the visualization method in this paper is to understand spatial point activity density with precision and meaning. The temporal tendency of the point process as an extension of the point density methodology is also discussed and displayed. Applications include visualization and measurement of any type of spatial point process. Visualization techniques integrate ggmap with examples from San Diego crime data.",

This paper shows how the R package GAS can be used for both the dynamic prediction and the evaluation of downside risk. Emphasis is given to the two key financial downside risk measures: Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). High-level functions for: (i) prediction, (ii) backtesting, and (iii) model comparison are discussed, and code examples are provided.

It enables developers to leverage Java solutions from within R by embedding code snippets or evaluating script files. This approach is generally easier than rJava’s low-level approach that employs the Java Native Interface. jsr223’s multi-language support is dependent on the Java Scripting API: an implementation of “JSR-223: Scripting for the Java Platform” that defines a framework to embed scripts in Java applications. The jsr223 package also features extensive data exchange capabilities and a callback interface that allows embedded scripts to access the current R session.

    "description": "A lot of effort has been spent over the past few decades in the QCA methodology field, to develop efficient Boolean minimization algorithms to derive an exact, and more importantly complete list of minimal prime implicants that explain the initial, observed positive configurations. As the complexity grows exponentially with every new condition, the required computer memory goes past the current computer resources and the polynomial time required to solve this problem quickly grows towards infinity. This paper introduces a new alternative to the existing non-polynomial attempts. It completely solves the memory problem, and preliminary tests show it is exponentially hundreds of time faster than eQMC, the current “best” algorithm for QCA in R, and probes into a territory where it competes and even outperforms engineering algorithms such as Espresso, for exact minimizations. While speed is not much of an issue now (eQMC is fast enough for simple data), it might prove to be essential when further developing towards all possible temporal orders, or searching for configurations in panel data over time, combined with / or automatic detection of difficult counterfactuals etc.",

    "title": "Basis-Adaptive Selection Algorithm in dr-package",
    "description": "Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) turns out to be a useful dimension reduction tool in high-dimensional regression analysis. Weisberg (2002) developed the dr-package to implement the four most popular SDR methods. However, the package does not provide any clear guidelines as to which method should be used given a data. Since the four methods may provide dramatically different dimension reduction results, the selection in the dr-package is problematic for statistical practitioners. In this paper, a basis-adaptive selection algorithm is developed in order to relieve this issue. The basic idea is to select an SDR method that provides the highest correlation between the basis estimates obtained by the four classical SDR methods. A real data example and numerical studies confirm the practical usefulness of the developed algorithm.",

    "description": "In independent component analysis (ICA) one searches for mutually independent non gaussian latent variables when the components of the multivariate data are assumed to be linear combinations of them. Arguably, the most popular method to perform ICA is FastICA. There are two classical versions, the deflation-based FastICA where the components are found one by one, and the symmetric FastICA where the components are found simultaneously. These methods have been implemented previously in two R packages, fastICA and ica. We present the R package fICA and compare it to the other packages. Additional features in fICA include optimization of the extraction order in the deflation-based version, possibility to use any nonlinearity function, and improvement to convergence of the deflation-based algorithm. The usage of the package is demonstrated by applying it to the real ECG data of a pregnant woman.",

    "description": "Many environmental and geographical models, such as those used in land degradation, agro ecological and climate studies, make use of spatially distributed inputs that are known imperfectly. The R package spup provides functions for examining the uncertainty propagation from input data and model parameters onto model outputs via the environmental model. The functions include uncertainty model specification, stochastic simulation and propagation of uncertainty using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. Uncertain variables are described by probability distributions. Both numerical and categorical data types are handled. The package also accommodates spatial auto-correlation within a variable and cross-correlation between variables. The MC realizations may be used as input to the environmental models written in or called from R. This article provides theoretical background and three worked examples that guide users through the application of spup.",

    "description": "Statistically approximating or “emulating” time series model output in parameter space is a common problem in climate science and other fields. There are many packages for spatio-temporal modeling. However, they often lack focus on time series, and exhibit statistical complexity. Here, we present the R package stilt designed for simplified AR(1) time series Gaussian process emulation, and provide examples relevant to climate modelling. Notably absent is Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation – a challenging concept to many scientists. We keep the number of user choices to a minimum. Hence, the package can be useful pedagogically, while still applicable to real life emulation problems. We provide functions for emulator cross-validation, empirical coverage, prediction, as well as response surface plotting. While the examples focus on climate model emulation, the emulator is general and can be also used for kriging spatio-temporal data.",

For semi-Markov models, sojourn times can be arbitrarily distributed, while sojourn times of Markov models are constrained to be exponentially distributed (in continuous time) or geometrically distributed (in discrete time). The aim of this paper is to present the R package SMM, devoted to the simulation and estimation of discrete time multi-state semi-Markov and Markov models. For the semi-Markov case we have considered: parametric and non-parametric estimation; with and without censoring at the beginning and/or at the end of sample paths; one or several independent sample paths. Several discrete-time distributions are considered for the parametric estimation of sojourn time distributions of semi-Markov chains: Uniform, Geometric, Poisson, Discrete Weibull and Binomial Negative.",

The implementation of multi-label algorithms, performed by different researchers, have several specificities, like input/output format, different internal functions, distinct programming language, to mention just some of them. As a result, current machine learning tools include only a small subset of multi-label decomposition strategies. The utiml package is a framework for the application of classification algorithms to multi-label data. Like the well known MULAN used with Weka, it provides a set of multi-label procedures such as sampling methods, transformation strategies, threshold functions, pre-processing techniques and evaluation metrics. The package was designed to allow users to easily perform complete multi-label classification experiments in the R environment.

    "description": "Machine learning methods can often learn high-dimensional functions which generalize well but are not human interpretable. The mmpf package marginalizes prediction functions using Monte-Carlo methods, allowing users to investigate the behavior of these learned functions, as on a lower dimensional subset of input features: partial dependence and variations thereof. This makes machine learning methods more useful in situations where accurate prediction is not the only goal, such as in the social sciences where linear models are commonly used because of their interpretability. Many methods for estimating prediction functions produce estimated functions which are not directly human-interpretable because of their complexity: for example, they may include high dimensional interactions and/or complex nonlinearities. While a learning method’s capacity to automatically learn interactions and nonlinearities is attractive when the goal is prediction, there are many cases where users want good predictions and the ability to understand how predictions depend on the features. mmpf implements general methods for interpreting prediction functions using Monte-Carlo methods. These methods allow any function which generates predictions to be be interpreted. mmpf is currently used in other packages for machine learning like edarf and mlr (Jones and Linder, 2016; Bischl et al., 2016).",

DR can be realized by a plethora of methods with different properties, objectives, and, hence, (dis)advantages. The resulting low-dimensional data embeddings are often difficult to compare with objective criteria. Here, we introduce the dimRed and coRanking packages for the R language. These open source software packages enable users to easily access multiple classical and advanced DR methods using a common interface. The packages also provide quality indicators for the embeddings and easy visualization of high dimensional data. The coRanking package provides the functionality for assessing DR methods in the co-ranking matrix framework. In tandem, these packages allow for uncovering complex structures high dimensional data. Currently 15 DR methods are available in the package, some of which were not previously available to R users. Here, we outline the dimRed and coRanking packages and make the implemented methods understandable to the interested reader.",

    "description": "R is a powerful tool for data processing, visualization, and modeling. However, R is slower than other languages used for similar purposes, such as Python. One reason for this is that R lacks base support for collections, abstract data types that store, manipulate, and return data (e.g., sets, maps, stacks). An exciting recent trend in the R extension ecosystem is the development of collection packages, packages that provide classes that implement common collections. At least 12 collection packages are available across the two major R extension repositories, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and Bioconductor. In this article, we compare collection packages in terms of their features, design philosophy, ease of use, and performance on benchmark tests. We demonstrate that, when used well, the data structures provided by collection packages are in many cases significantly faster than the data structures provided by base R. We also highlight current deficiencies among R collection packages and propose avenues of possible improvement.

In this paper, we demonstrate how R can be used to obtain disease risk estimates and quantify risk factors using areal data. We explain how to define disease risk models and how to perform Bayesian inference using the INLA package. We also show how to make interactive maps of estimates using the leaflet package to better understand the disease spatial patterns and communicate the results. We show an example of lung cancer risk in Pennsylvania, United States, in year 2002, and demonstrate that R represents an excellent tool for disease surveillance by enabling reproducible health data analysis.",

    "description": "Detecting outliers in a multivariate and unsupervised context is an important and ongoing problem notably for quality control. Many statistical methods are already implemented in R and are briefly surveyed in the present paper. But only a few lead to the accurate identification of potential outliers in the case of a small level of contamination. In this particular context, the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method shows remarkable properties for identifying outliers that lie on a low-dimensional subspace in its first invariant components. It is implemented in the ICSOutlier package. The main function of the package, ics.outlier, offers the possibility of labelling potential outliers in a completely automated way. Four examples, including two real examples in quality control, illustrate the use of the function. Comparing with several other approaches, it appears that ICS is generally as efficient as its competitors and shows an advantage in the context of a small proportion of outliers lying in a low-dimensional subspace. In quality control, the method may help in properly identifying some defective products while not detecting too many false positives.",

RealVAMS utilizes a multivariate generalized linear mixed model with pseudo-likelihood approximation for fitting normally distributed continuous response(s) jointly with a binary outcome. In an educational context, the model is referred to as a multidimensional value-added model, which extends previous theory to estimate the relationships between potential teacher contributions toward different student outcomes and to allow the consideration of a binary, real-world outcome such as graduation. The simultaneous joint modeling of continuous and binary outcomes was not available prior to RealVAMS due to computational difficulties. In this paper, we discuss the multidimensional model, describe RealVAMS, and demonstrate the use of this package and its modeling options with an educational data set.",

It provides users with the ability to explore the relationship between a dependent variable and its independent variables. The package offers an easy and data-driven way to choose a functional form in multiple linear regression models by comparing a range of parametric transformations. The parametric functional forms are benchmarked against each other and a non-parametric transformation. The package allows users to generate plots that show the relation between a covariate and the dependent variable. Furthermore, PanJen will enable users to specify specific functional transformations, driven by a priori and theory-based hypotheses. The package supplies both model fits and plots that allow users to make informed choices on the functional forms in their regression. We show that the ranking in PanJen outperforms the Box-Tidwell transformation, especially in the presence of inefficiency, heteroscedasticity or endogeneity.",

Nevertheless, SDM pro jections are affected by a wide range of uncertainty factors (related to training data, climate projections and SDM techniques), which limit their potential value and credibility. The new package mopa pro vides tools for designing comprehensive multi-factor SDM ensemble experiments, combining multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. baseline climate, pseudo-absence realizations, SDM techniques, future projections) and allowing to assess their contribution to the overall spread of the ensemble projection. In addition, mopa is seamlessly integrated with the climate4R bundle and allows straightforward retrieval and post-processing of state-of-the-art climate datasets (including observations and climate change projections), thus facilitating the proper analysis of key uncertainty factors related to climate data.",

In FHDI, each missing item is filled with multiple observed values yielding a single completed data set for subsequent analyses. An R package FHDI is developed to perform FHDI and also the fully efficient fractional imputation (FEFI) method of (Fuller and Kim, 2005) to impute multivariate missing data with arbitrary missing patterns. FHDI substitutes missing items with a few observed values jointly obtained from a set of donors whereas the FEFI uses all the possible donors. This paper introduces FHDI as a tool for implementing the multivariate version of fractional hot deck imputation discussed in Im et al. (2015) as well as FEFI. For variance estimation of FHDI and FEFI, the Jackknife method is implemented, and replicated weights are provided as a part of the output.",

In general, as companies seek to minimize economic losses, studies on problems of multi-agent inventory have increased in recent years. A multi-agent inventory problem is a situation in which several agents face individual inventory problems and agree to coordinate their orders with the objective of reducing their costs. The R package Inventorymodel allows the determination of both the optimal policy for some inventory situations with deterministic demands and the allocation of costs from a game-theoretic perspective. The required calculations may be computed for any number of agents although the computational complexity of this class of problems when the involved agents enlarge is not reduced. In this work, the different possibilities that the package offers are described and some examples of usage are also demonstrated.",

Variation in statistical characteristics of univariate time series can have a profound effect on characteristics of missing observations and, therefore, the accuracy of different imputation methods. The imputeTestbench package can be used to compare the prediction accuracy of different methods as related to the amount and type of missing data for a user-supplied dataset. Missing data are simulated by removing observations completely at random or in blocks of different sizes depending on characteristics of the data. Several imputation algorithms are included with the package that vary from simple replacement with means to more complex interpolation methods. The testbench is not limited to the default functions and users can add or remove methods as needed. Plotting functions also allow comparative visualization of the behavior and effectiveness of different algorithms. We present example applications that demonstrate how the package can be used to understand differences in prediction accuracy between methods as affected by characteristics of a dataset and the nature of missing data.",

Here, we present a package intended to facilitate integration of R with the open-source database software PostgreSQL, with a focus on its spatial extension, PostGIS. The package rpostgis (version 1.4.1) provides methods for spatial data handling (vector and raster) between PostGIS-enabled databases and R, methods for R \"data.frame\"s storage in PostgreSQL, and a set of convenient wrappers for common database procedures. We thus expect rpostgis to be useful for both (1) existing users of spatial data in R and/or PostGIS, and (2) R users who have yet to adopt relational databases for their projects.",

Rather than selecting a particular parametric exponential family model, such as the Poisson distribution, this semiparametric glm assumes that the response is drawn from the more general exponential tilt family. The regression coefficients and unspecified reference distribution are estimated by maximizing a semiparametric like lihood. The new algorithm incorporates several computational stability and efficiency improvements over the algorithm originally proposed. In particular, the new algorithm performs well for either small or large support for the nonparametric response distribution. The algorithm is implemented in a new R package called gldrm.",

    "description": "The paper describes two algorithms for financial portfolio optimization with the following risk measures: CVaR, MAD, LSAD and dispersion CVaR. These algorithms can be applied to discrete distributions of asset returns since then the optimization problems can be reduced to linear programs. The first algorithm solves a simple recourse problem as described by Haneveld using Benders de composition method. The second algorithm finds an optimal portfolio with the smallest distance to a given benchmark portfolio and is an adaptation of the least norm solution (called also normal solution) of linear programs due to Zhao and Li. The algorithms are implemented in R in the package PortfolioOptim.",

    "description": "Disparities in economic welfare, inequality and poverty across and within countries are of great interest to sociologists, economists, researchers, social organizations and political scientists. Information about these topics is commonly based on surveys. We present a package called rtip that implements techniques based on stochastic dominance to make unambiguous comparisons, in terms of welfare, poverty and inequality, among income distributions. Besides providing point estimates and confidence intervals for the most commonly used indicators of these characteristics, the package rtip estimates the usual Lorenz curve, the generalized Lorenz curve, the TIP (Three I’s of Poverty) curve and allows to test statistically whether one curve is dominated by another.",

    "description": "High-dimensional longitudinal data pose a serious challenge for statistical inference as many test statistics cannot be computed for high-dimensional data, or they do not maintain the nominal type-I error rate, or have very low power. Therefore, it is necessary to derive new inference methods capable of dealing with high dimensionality, and to make them available to statistics practitioners. One such method is implemented in the package HRM described in this article. This new method uses a similar approach as the Welch-Satterthwaite t-test approximation and works very well for high-dimensional data as long as the data distribution is not too skewed or heavy-tailed. The package also provides a GUI to offer an easy way to apply the methods.",

Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. Multivariate models can be fit as well. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing relevant aspects of the syntax.",

Three approaches are available in the package: The regression approach takes censoring into account when formulating the inequality constraints of the support vector problem. In the ranking approach, the inequality constraints set the objective to maximize the concordance index for comparable pairs of observations. The hybrid approach combines the regression and ranking constraints in a single model. We describe survival support vector machines and their implementation, provide examples and compare the prediction performance with the Cox proportional hazards model, random survival forests and gradient boosting using several real datasets. On these datasets, survival support vector machines perform on par with the reference methods.",

We present a family of nonparametric tests that are computationally efficient and powerful for detecting any type of dependence between a pair of univariate random variables. The computational complexity of the suggested tests is sub-quadratic in sample size, allowing calculation of test statistics for millions of observations. We survey both algorithms and the HHG package in which they are implemented, with usage examples showing the implementation of the proposed tests for both the independence case and the k-sample problem. The tests are compared to existing nonparametric tests via several simulation studies comparing both runtime and power. Special focus is given to the design of data structures used in implementation of the tests. These data structures can be useful for developers of nonparametric distribution-free tests.",

Analytical solutions for the density and distribution are usually cumbersome to find and difficult to compute. Several methods have been developed to approximate the distribution, among which is the saddlepoint approximation. However, implementation of the saddlepoint approximation is non-trivial. In this paper, we implement the saddlepoint approximation in the sinib package and provide two examples to illustrate its usage. One example uses simulated data while the other uses real-world healthcare data. The sinib package addresses the gap between the theory and the implementation of approximating the sum of independent non-identical binomials.",

From the user’s point of view, the function is similar to coxph (in the survival package) and other widely used model-fitting functions. Convenient software has not previously been available for Estimator III since it is complicated to calculate. SAS and S-Plus code-fragments for the calculation have been published, but cchs is easier to use and more efficient in terms of time and memory, and can cope with much larger datasets.

    "description": "The purpose of this paper is to introduce the R package InfoTrad for estimating the proba bility of informed trading (PIN) initially proposed by Easley et al. (1996). PIN is a popular information asymmetry measure that proxies the proportion of informed traders in the market. This study provides a short survey on alternative estimation techniques for the PIN. There are many problems documented in the existing literature in estimating PIN. InfoTrad package aims to address two problems. First, the sequential trading structure proposed by Easley et al. (1996) and later extended by Easley et al. (2002) is prone to sample selection bias for stocks with large trading volumes, due to floating point exception. This problem is solved by different factorizations provided by Easley et al. (2010) (EHO factorization) and Lin and Ke (2011) (LK factorization). Second, the estimates are prone to bias due to boundary solutions. A grid-search algorithm (YZ algorithm) is proposed by Yan and Zhang (2012) to overcome the bias introduced due to boundary estimates. In recent years, clustering algorithms have become popular due to their flexibility in quickly handling large data sets. Gan et al. (2015) propose an algorithm (GAN algorithm) to estimate PIN using hierarchical agglomerative clustering which is later extended by Ersan and Alici (2016) (EA algorithm). The package InfoTrad offers LK and EHO factorizations given an input matrix and initial parameter vector. In addition, these factorizations can be used to estimate PIN through YZ algorithm, GAN algorithm and EA algorithm.",

    "title": "A System for an Accountable Data Analysis Process in R",
    "description": "Efficiently producing transparent analyses may be difficult for beginners or tedious for the experienced. This implies a need for computing systems and environments that can efficiently satisfy reproducibility and accountability standards. To this end, we have developed a system, R package, and R Shiny application called adapr (Accountable Data Analysis Process in R) that is built on the principle of accountable units. An accountable unit is a data file (statistic, table or graphic) that can be associated with a provenance, meaning how it was created, when it was created and who created it, and this is similar to the ’verifiable computational results’ (VCR) concept proposed by Gavish and Donoho. Both accountable units and VCRs are version controlled, sharable, and can be incorporated into a collaborative project. However, accountable units use file hashes and do not involve watermarking or public repositories like VCRs. Reproducing collaborative work may be highly complex, requiring repeating computations on multiple systems from multiple authors; however, determining the provenance of each unit is simpler, requiring only a search using file hashes and version control systems.",

    "title": "Epistemic Game Theory: Putting Algorithms to Work",
    "description": "The aim of this study is to construct an epistemic model in which each rational choice under common belief in rationality is supplemented by a type which expresses such a belief. In practice, the finding of type depends on manual solution approach with some mathematical operations in scope of the theory. This approach becomes less convenient with the growth of the size of the game. To solve this difficulty, a linear programming model is constructed for two-player, static and non-cooperative games to find the type that is supporting that player’s rational choice is optimal under common belief in rationality and maximizing the utility of the game. Since the optimal choice would only be made from rational choices, it is first necessary to eliminate all strictly dominated choices. In real life, the games are usually large sized. Therefore, the elimination process should be performed in a computer environment. Since software related to game theory was mostly prepared with a result-oriented approach for some types of games, it was necessary to develop software to execute the iterated elimination method. With this regard, a program has been developed that determines the choices that are strictly dominated by pure and randomized choices in two-player games. Two functions named “esdc” and “type” are created by using R statistical programming language for the operations performed in both parts, and these functions are added to the content of an R package after its creation with the name EpistemicGameTheory.",

    "description": "Integrating R with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) extends R’s statistical capabilities with numerous geoprocessing and data handling tools available in a GIS. QGIS is one of the most popular open-source GIS, and it furthermore integrates other GIS programs such as the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) GIS and the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS within a single software environment. This and its QGIS Python API makes it a perfect candidate for console-based geoprocessing. By establishing an interface, the R package RQGIS makes it possible to use QGIS as a geoprocessing workhorse from within R. Compared to other packages building a bridge to GIS (e.g., rgrass7, RSAGA, RPyGeo), RQGIS offers a wider range of geoalgorithms, and is often easier to use due to various convenience functions. Finally, RQGIS supports the seamless integration of Python code using reticulate from within R for improved extendability.",

    "description": "Treatment switching in a randomised controlled trial occurs when participants change from their randomised treatment to the other trial treatment during the study. Failure to account for treatment switching in the analysis (i.e. by performing a standard intention-to-treat analysis) can lead to biased estimates of treatment efficacy. The rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) is a method used to adjust for treatment switching in trials with survival outcomes. The RPSFTM is due to Robins and Tsiatis (1991) and has been developed by White et al. (1997, 1999). The method is randomisation based and uses only the randomised treatment group, observed event times, and treatment history in order to estimate a causal treatment effect. The treatment effect, ψ, is estimated by balancing counter-factual event times (that would be observed if no treatment were received) between treatment groups. G-estimation is used to find the value of ψ such that a test statistic Z (ψ) = 0. This is usually the test statistic used in the intention-to-treat analysis, for example, the log rank test statistic. We present an R package, rpsftm, that implements the method.",

The Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) and quantile scores are obtained from the GPS model estimates. openEBGM provides for the evaluation of counts using a number of different methods, including the model-based disproportionality scores, the relative reporting ratio (RR), and the proportional reporting ratio (PRR). Data squashing for computational efficiency and stratification for confounding variable adjustment are included. Application to adverse event detection is discussed.",

    "description": "The alleHap package is designed for imputing genetic missing data and reconstruct non recombinant haplotypes from pedigree databases in a deterministic way. When genotypes of related individuals are available in a number of linked genetic markers, the program starts by identifying haplotypes compatible with the observed genotypes in those markers without missing values. If haplotypes are identified in parents or offspring, missing alleles can be imputed in subjects containing missing values. Several scenarios are analyzed: family completely genotyped, children partially genotyped and parents completely genotyped, children fully genotyped and parents containing entirely or partially missing genotypes, and founders and their offspring both only partially genotyped. The alleHap package also has a function to simulate pedigrees including all these scenarios. This article describes in detail how our package works for the desired applications, including illustrated explanations and easily reproducible examples.",

    "description": "Recently, Mazucheli (2017) uploaded the package mle.tools to CRAN. It can be used for bias corrections of maximum likelihood estimates through the methodology proposed by Cox and Snell (1968). The main function of the package, coxsnell.bc(), computes the bias corrected maximum likelihood estimates. Although in general, the bias corrected estimators may be expected to have better sampling properties than the uncorrected estimators, analytical expressions from the formula proposed by Cox and Snell (1968) are either tedious or impossible to obtain. The purpose of this paper is twofolded: to introduce the mle.tools package, especially the coxsnell.bc() function; secondly, to compare, for thirty one continuous distributions, the bias estimates from the coxsnell.bc() function and the bias estimates from analytical expressions available in the literature. We also compare, for five distributions, the observed and expected Fisher information. Our numerical experiments show that the functions are efficient to estimate the biases by the Cox-Snell formula and for calculating the observed and expected Fisher information.",

Estimating the intrinsic dimension of an observed dataset is an essential preliminary step for dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, and visualization.

The BayesBD package implements flexible Gaussian process priors indexed by the circle to recover the boundary in a binary or Gaussian noised image. The boundary recovered by BayesBD has the practical advantages of guaranteed geometric restrictions and convenient joint inferences under certain assumptions, in addition to its desirable theoretical property of achieving (nearly) minimax optimal rate in a way that is adaptive to the unknown smoothness. The core sampling tasks for our model have linear complexity, and are implemented in C++ for computational efficiency using packages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. Users can access the full functionality of the package in both the command line and the corresponding shiny application. Additionally, the package includes numerous utility functions to aid users in data preparation and analysis of results. We compare BayesBD with selected existing packages using both simulations and real data applications, demonstrating the excellent performance and flexibility of BayesBD even when the observation contains complicated structural information that may violate its assumptions.",

    "description": "Requiring no analytical forms, nonparametric discrete patterns are flexible in representing complex relationships among random variables. This makes them increasingly useful for data-driven applications. However, there appears to be no software tools for simulating nonparametric discrete patterns, which prevents objective evaluation of statistical methods that discover discrete relationships from data. We present a simulator to generate nonparametric discrete functions as contingency tables. User can request strictly many-to-one functional patterns. The simulator can also produce contingency tables representing dependent non-functional and independent relationships. An option is provided to apply random noise to contingency tables. We demonstrate the utility of the simulator by showing the advantage of the FunChisq test over Pearson’s chi-square test in detecting functional patterns. This simulator, implemented in the function simulate_tables in the R package FunChisq (version 2.4.0 or greater), offers an important means to evaluate the performance of nonparametric statistical pattern discovery methods.",

The package provides several options for visualizing models with interactions, including lattice plots, contour plots, and both static and interactive perspective plots. The implementation of the package is designed to be fully object-oriented and interface seamlessly with R’s rich collection of model classes, allowing a consistent interface for visualizing not only linear models, but generalized linear models, proportional hazards models, generalized additive models, robust regression models, and many more.",

Sifting manually through extensive sets of rules is time-consuming and strenuous. Visualization and espe cially interactive visualization has a long history of making large amounts of data better accessible. The R-extension package arulesViz provides most popular visualization techniques for association rules.

The proposal departs from an existing SAS program which implements Johansen’s general formulation of Welch-James’s statistic with approximate degrees of freedom, which makes it suitable for testing any linear hypothesis concerning cell means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when the data pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Improved type I error rate control is obtained using bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical value, whereas robustness against non-normality is achieved through trimmed means and Winsorized variances. A wrapper function eases the application of the test in common situations, such as performing omnibus tests on all effects and interactions, pairwise contrasts, and tetrad contrasts of two-way interactions. The package is demonstrated in several problems including unbalanced univariate and multivariate designs.",

This paper intends to fill a gap in current R software, where tools for repeated evaluation of functions as Fourier integrals are not directly available. We implement two approaches for such computations with numerical integration. In particular, if the argument collection for evaluation corresponds to a regular grid, then an algorithm from Inverarity (2002) may be employed based on a fast Fourier transform, which creates significant improvements in the speed over a second approach to numerical Fourier integration (where the latter also applies to cases where the points for evaluation are not on a grid). We illustrate the package with the computation of probability densities and characteristic functions through Fourier integrals/transforms, for both univariate and bivariate examples.",

    "description": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used to measure molecular and colloidal inter actions as well as mechanical properties of biomaterials. In this paper the afmToolkit R package is introduced. This package allows the user to automatically batch process AFM force-distance and force-time curves. afmToolkit capabilities range from importing ASCII files and preprocessing the curves (contact point detection, baseline correction. . . ) for finding relevant physical information, such as Young’s modulus, adhesion energies and exponential decay for force relaxation and creep experiments. This package also contains plotting, summary and feature extraction functions. The package also comes with several data sets so the user can test the aforementioned features with ease. The package afmToolkit eases the basic processing of large amount of AFM F-d/t curves at once. It is also flexible enough to easily incorporate new functions as they are needed and can be seen as a programming infrastructure for further algorithm development.",

The genotype to phenotype mapping is modeled after the Incomplete Dominance Inheritance, overpassing the necessity to define a dominance scheme.

A new approach to crossover, inspired from the random assortment of chromosomes during meiosis is included. Several mutation operators, inspired from genetics, are also proposed. The package is fully compatible with the data formats used in Bioconductor and MLInterfaces package, readily applicable to microarray studies, but is flexible to other feature selection applications from high dimensional data. Several options for the visualization of evolution and outcomes are implemented to facilitate the interpretation of results. The package’s functionality is illustrated by examples.",

In this paper, we present a package CRTgeeDR developed for cluster randomized trials with missing data (CRTs). For use of inverse probability weighting to adjust for missing data in cluster randomized trials, we show that other software lead to biased estimation for non-independence working correlation structure. CRTgeeDR solves this problem. We also extend the ability of existing packages to allow augmented Doubly Robust GEE estimation (DR). Simulation studies demonstrate the consistency of estimators implemented in CRTgeeDR compared to packages such as geepack and the gains associated with the use of the DR for analyzing a binary outcome using a logistic regression. Finally, we illustrate the method on data from a sanitation CRT in developing countries.",

    "description": "As the number of cyber-attacks continues to grow on a daily basis, so does the delay in threat detection. For instance, in 2015, the Office of Personnel Management discovered that approximately 21.5 million individual records of Federal employees and contractors had been stolen. On average, the time between an attack and its discovery is more than 200 days. In the case of the OPM breach, the attack had been going on for almost a year. Currently, cyber analysts inspect numerous potential incidents on a daily basis, but have neither the time nor the resources available to perform such a task. anomalyDetection aims to curtail the time frame in which anomalous cyber activities go unnoticed and to aid in the efficient discovery of these anomalous transactions among the millions of daily logged events by i) providing an efficient means for pre-processing and aggregating cyber data for analysis by employing a tabular vector transformation and handling multicollinearity concerns; ii) offering numerous built-in multivariate statistical functions such as Mahalanobis distance, factor analysis, principal components analysis to identify anomalous activity, iii) incorporating the pipe operator (%>%) to allow it to work well in the tidyverse workflow. Combined, anomalyDetection offers cyber analysts an efficient and simplified approach to break up network events into time-segment blocks and identify periods associated with suspected anomalies for further evaluation.",

For the expectation maximization algorithm Wald confidence intervals based on the Fisher information estimation method of Oakes (1999) are provided. For the Gibbs sampling approach, equal-tailed credibility intervals can be obtained. In order to visualize the parameter estimates, a matrix plot function is provided.

The R package cleanNLP, which calls one of two state of the art NLP libraries (CoreNLP or spaCy), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It takes raw text as an input and returns a list of normalized tables.

Interrogation of metabolic reconstructions are generally carried through Flux Balance Analysis, an optimization method in which the biological sense of the optimal solution is highly sensitive to thermodynamic unbalance caused by the presence of stoichiometric reactions whose compounds are not produced or consumed in any other reaction (orphan metabolites) and by mass unbalance. The minval package was designed as a tool to identify orphan metabolites and evaluate the mass and charge balance of stoichiometric reactions.

    "description": "Research on climate change impacts can require extensive processing of climate model output, especially when using ensemble techniques to incorporate output from multiple climate models and multiple simulations of each model. This processing can be particularly extensive when identifying and characterizing multi-day extreme events like heat waves and frost day spells, as these must be processed from model output with daily time steps. Further, climate model output is in a format and follows standards that may be unfamiliar to most R users. Here, we provide an overview of working with daily climate model output data in R. We then present the futureheatwaves package, which we developed to ease the process of identifying, characterizing, and exploring multi-day extreme events in climate model output. This package can input a directory of climate model output files, identify all extreme events using customizable event definitions, and summarize the output using user-specified functions.",

It includes functions dedicated to the distribution of final numbers of mutant cells. Parametric estimation and hypothesis testing are also implemented, enabling inference on different sorts of data with several possible methods. An overview of the subject is proposed. The general form of mutation models is described, including the classical models as particular cases. Estimating from a model, when the data have been generated by another, induces different possible biases, which are identified and discussed. The three estimation methods available in the package are described, and their mean squared errors are compared. Finally, implementation is discussed, and a few examples of usage on real data sets are given.",

    "title": "checkmate: Fast Argument Checks for Defensive R Programming",
    "description": "Dynamically typed programming languages like R allow programmers to write generic, flexible and concise code and to interact with the language using an interactive Read-eval-print-loop (REPL). However, this flexibility has its price: As the R interpreter has no information about the expected variable type, many base functions automatically convert the input instead of raising an exception. Unfortunately, this frequently leads to runtime errors deeper down the call stack which obfuscates the original problem and renders debugging challenging. Even worse, unwanted conver sions can remain undetected and skew or invalidate the results of a statistical analysis. As a resort, assertions can be employed to detect unexpected input during runtime and to signal understandable and traceable errors. The package checkmate provides a plethora of functions to check the type and related properties of the most frequently used R objects and variable types. The package is mostly written in C to avoid any unnecessary performance overhead. Thus, the programmer can conveniently write concise, well-tested assertions which outperforms custom R code for many applications. Fur thermore, checkmate simplifies writing unit tests using the framework testthat (Wickham, 2011) by extending it with plenty of additional expectation functions, and registered C routines are available for package developers to perform assertions on arbitrary SEXPs (internal data structure for R objects implemented as struct in C) in compiled code.",

    "description": "Linguistic distance measurements are commonly used in anthropology and biology when quantitative and statistical comparisons between words are needed. This is common, for example, when analyzing linguistic and genetic data. Such comparisons can provide insight into historical population patterns and evolutionary processes. However, the most commonly used linguistic distances are derived from edit distances, which do not weight phonetic features that may, for example, represent smaller-scale patterns in linguistic evolution. Thus, computational methods for calculating feature-weighted linguistic distances are needed for linguistic, biological, and evolutionary applications; additionally, the linguistic distances presented here are generic and may have broader applications in fields such as text mining and search, as well as applications in psycholinguistics and morphology. To facilitate this research, we are making available an open-source R software package that performs feature-weighted linguistic distance calculations. The package also includes a supervised learning methodology that uses a genetic algorithm and manually determined alignments to estimate 13 linguistic parameters including feature weights and a skip penalty. Here we present the package and use it to demonstrate the supervised learning methodology by estimating the optimal linguistic parameters for both simulated data and for a sample of Austronesian languages. Our results show that the methodology can estimate these parameters for both simulated and real language data, that optimizing feature weights improves alignment accuracy by approximately 29%, and that optimization significantly affects the resulting distance measurements.

    "title": "Implementing a Metapopulation Bass Diffusion Model using the R Package deSolve",
    "description": "Diffusion is a fundamental process in physical, biological, social and economic settings. Consumer products often go viral, with sales driven by the word of mouth effect, as their adoption spreads through a population. The classic diffusion model used for product adoption is the Bass diffusion model, and this divides a population into two groups of people: potential adopters who are likely to adopt a product, and adopters who have purchased the product, and influence others to adopt. The Bass diffusion model is normally captured in an aggregate form, where no significant consumer differences are modeled. This paper extends the Bass model to capture a spatial perspective, using metapopulation equations from the field of infectious disease modeling. The paper’s focus is on simulation of deterministic models by solving ordinary differential equations, and does not encompass parameter estimation. The metapopulation model in implemented in R using the deSolve package, and shows the potential of using the R framework to implement large-scale integral equation models, with applications in the field of marketing and consumer behaviour.",

    "description": "The MDplot package provides plotting functions to allow for automated visualisation of molecular dynamics simulation output. It is especially useful in cases where the plot generation is rather tedious due to complex file formats or when a large number of plots are generated. The graphs that are supported range from those which are standard, such as RMSD/RMSF (root-mean-square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation, respectively) to less standard, such as thermodynamic integration analysis and hydrogen bond monitoring over time. All told, they address many com monly used analyses. In this article, we set out the MDplot package’s functions, give examples of the function calls, and show the associated plots. Plotting and data parsing is separated in all cases, i.e. the respective functions can be used independently. Thus, data manipulation and the integration of additional file formats is fairly easy. Currently, the loading functions support GROMOS, GROMACS, and AMBER file formats. Moreover, we also provide a Bash interface that allows simple embedding of MDplot into Bash scripts as the final analysis step. Availability: The package can be obtained in the latest major version from CRAN (https://cran.r project.org/package=MDplot) or in the most recent version from the project’s GitHub page at https://github.com/MDplot/MDplot, where feedback is also most welcome.

The R package GA provides a collection of general purpose functions for optimisation using genetic algorithms. This paper describes some enhancements recently introduced in version 3 of the package. In particular, hybrid GAs have been implemented by including the option to perform local searches during the evolution. This allows to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local optimiser. Another major improvement is the provision of facilities for parallel computing. Parallelisation has been implemented using both the master-slave approach and the islands evolution model. Several examples of usage are presented, with both real-world data examples and benchmark functions, showing that often high-quality solutions can be obtained more efficiently.",

It offers multiple state-of-the-art imputation algorithm implementations along with plotting functions for time series missing data statistics. While imputation in general is a well-known problem and widely covered by R packages, finding packages able to fill missing values in univariate time series is more complicated. The reason for this lies in the fact, that most imputation algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation instead needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an introduction to the imputeTS package and its provided algorithms and tools. Furthermore, it gives a short overview about univariate time series imputation in R.",

    "title": "Update of the nlme Package to Allow a Fixed Standard Deviation of the Residual Error",
    "description": "The use of linear and non-linear mixed models in the life sciences and pharmacometrics is common practice. Estimation of the parameters of models not involving a system of differential equations is often done by the R or S-Plus software with the nonlinear mixed effects nlme package. The estimated residual error may be used for diagnosis of the fitted model, but not whether the model correctly describes the relation between response and included variables including the true covariance structure. The latter is only true if the residual error is known in advance. Therefore, it may be necessary or more appropriate to fix the residual error a priori instead of estimate its value. This can be the case if one wants to include evidence from past studies or a theoretical derivation; e.g., when using a binomial model. S-Plus has an option to fix this residual error to a constant, in contrast to R. For convenience, the nlme package was customized to offer this option as well. In this paper, we derived the log-likelihoods for the mixed models using a fixed residual error. By using some well-known examples from mixed models, we demonstrated the equivalence of R and S-Plus with respect to the estimates. The updated package has been accepted by the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) team and will be available at the CRAN website.",

    "description": "EMSaov is a new R package that we developed to provide users with an analysis of variance table including the expected mean squares (EMS) for various types of experimental design. It is not easy to find the appropriate test, particularly the denominator for the F statistic that depends on the EMS, when some variables exhibit random effects or when we use a special experimental design such as nested design, repeated measures design, or split-plot design. With EMSaov, a user can easily find the F statistic denominator and can determine how to analyze the data when using a special experimental design. We also develop a web application with a GUI interface using the shiny package in R . We expect that our application can contribute to the efficient and easy analysis of experimental data.",

Ordinary multiple instance data consists of many independent bags, and each bag is composed of several instances. The statuses of bags and instances are binary. Moreover, the statuses of instances are not observed, whereas the statuses of bags are observed. The functions in this package are applicable for analyzing multiple-instance data, simulating data via logistic regression, and selecting important covariates in the regression model. To this end, maximum likelihood estimation with an expectation-maximization algorithm is implemented for model estimation, and a lasso penalty added to the likelihood function is applied for variable selection. Additionally, an \"milr\" object is applicable to generic functions fitted, predict and summary. Simulated data and a real example are given to demonstrate the features of this package.",

In this paper we present an R package, spcadjust, which implements a bootstrap based method for adjusting monitoring schemes to take into account the estimation error. By bootstrapping the past data this method guarantees, with a certain probability, a conditional performance of the chart. In spcadjust the method is implement for various types of Shewhart, CUSUM and EWMA charts, various performance criteria, and both parametric and non-parametric bootstrap schemes. In addition to the basic charts, charts based on linear and logistic regression models for risk adjusted monitoring are included, and it is easy for the user to add further charts. Use of the package is demonstrated by examples.",

    "description": "In clinical practice, it is very useful to select an optimal cutpoint in the scale of a continuous biomarker or diagnostic test for classifying individuals as healthy or diseased. Several methods for choosing optimal cutpoints have been presented in the literature, depending on the ultimate goal. One of these methods, the generalized symmetry point, recently introduced, generalizes the symmetry point by incorporating the misclassification costs. Two statistical approaches have been proposed in the literature for estimating this optimal cutpoint and its associated sensitivity and specificity measures, a parametric method based on the generalized pivotal quantity and a nonparametric method based on empirical likelihood. In this paper, we introduce GsymPoint, an R package that implements these methods in a user-friendly environment, allowing the end-user to calculate the generalized symmetry point depending on the levels of certain categorical covariates. The practical use of this package is illustrated using three real biomedical datasets.",

Unfortunately, it can be challenging to understand the results of such models and explain them to management. Partial dependence plots offer a simple solution. Partial dependence plots are low dimensional graphical renderings of the prediction function so that the relationship between the outcome and predictors of interest can be more easily understood. These plots are especially useful in explaining the output from black box models. In this paper, we introduce pdp, a general R package for constructing partial dependence plots.",

A reparameterization step is introduced to enforce sparsity while at the same time keeping the objective function smooth. As a result, MIC is computationally fast with a superior performance in sparse estimation. Furthermore, the reparameterization tactic yields an additional advantage in terms of circumventing post-selection inference (Leeb and Pötscher, 2005). The MIC method and its R implementation are introduced and illustrated with the PBC data.",

The clustering part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its usage with minimum efforts. This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also provides a simple example. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository.",

    "description": "Heat maps are commonly used to display the spatial distribution of a response observed on a two-dimensional grid. The autoimage package provides convenient functions for constructing multiple heat maps in unified, seamless way, particularly when working with projected coordinates. The autoimage package natively supports: 1. automatic inclusion of a color scale with the plotted image, 2. construction of heat maps for responses observed on regular or irregular grids, as well as non-gridded data, 3. construction of a matrix of heat maps with a common color scale, 4. construction of a matrix of heat maps with individual color scales, 5. projecting coordinates before plotting, 6. easily adding geographic borders, points, and other features to the heat maps. After comparing the autoimage package’s capabilities for constructing heat maps to those of existing tools, a carefully selected set of examples is used to highlight the capabilities of the autoimage package.",

    "description": "Data-only packages offer a way to provide extended functionality for other R users. However, such packages can be large enough to exceed the package size limit (5 megabytes) for the Comprehen sive R Archive Network (CRAN). As an alternative, large data packages can be posted to additional repostiories beyond CRAN itself in a way that allows smaller code packages on CRAN to access and use the data. The drat package facilitates creation and use of such alternative repositories and makes it particularly simple to host them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on packages posted to drat repositories through the use of the ‘Additonal_repositories’ field in the DESCRIPTION file. This paper describes how R users can create a suite of coordinated packages, in which larger data packages are hosted in an alternative repository created with drat, while a smaller code package that interacts with this data is created that can be submitted to CRAN.",

Data are served through the NRFA web services via experimental RESTful APIs. Obtaining NRFA data can be unwieldy due to complexities in handling HTTP GET requests and parsing responses in JSON and XML formats. The rnrfa package provides a set of functions to programmatically access, filter, and visualize NRFA data using simple R syntax. This paper describes the structure of the rnrfa package, including examples using the main functions gdf() and cmr() for flow and rainfall data, respectively. Visualization examples are also provided with a shiny web application and functions provided in the package.

Within the database community there exist many different solutions for the specification and calculation of Pareto frontiers, also called Skyline queries in the database context. Slight generalizations like the combination of the Pareto operator with the lexicographical order have been established under the term database preferences. In this paper we present the rPref package which allows to efficiently deal with these concepts within R. With its help, database preferences can be specified in a very similar way as in a state-of-the-art database management system. Our package provides algorithms for an efficient calculation of the Pareto-optimal set and further functionalities for visualizing and analyzing the induced preference order.",

    "description": "The WeDiBaDis package provides a user friendly environment to perform discriminant analysis (supervised classification). WeDiBaDis is an easy to use package addressed to the biological and medical communities, and in general, to researchers interested in applied studies. It can be suitable when the user is interested in the problem of constructing a discriminant rule on the basis of distances between a relatively small number of instances or units of known unbalanced-class membership measured on many (possibly thousands) features of any type. This is a current situation when analyzing genetic biomedical data. This discriminant rule can then be used both, as a means of explaining differences among classes, but also in the important task of assigning the class membership for new unlabeled units. Our package implements two discriminant analysis procedures in an R environment: the well-known distance-based discriminant analysis (DB-discriminant) and a weighted distance-based discriminant (WDB-discriminant), a novel classifier rule that we introduce. This new procedure is based on an improvement of the DB rule taking into account the statistical depth of the units. This article presents both classifying procedures and describes the implementation of each in detail. We illustrate the use of the package using an ecological and a genetic experimental example. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the new proposed procedure (WDB), as compared with DB. This comparison is carried out using thirty-eight, high-dimensional, class-unbalanced, cancer data sets, three of which include clinical features.",

The condSURV package provides three different approaches all based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In one of these approaches these quantities are estimated conditionally on current or past covariate measures. Illustration of the software usage is included using real data.",

There are a number of analysis tools which are used to guide researchers through their analysis. Some of these tools are commercial and provide basic methods for ROC curve analysis while others offer advanced analysis techniques and a command-based user interface, such as the R environment. The R environmentg includes comprehensive tools for ROC curve analysis; however, using a command-based interface might be challenging and time consuming when a quick evaluation is desired; especially for non-R users, physicians etc. Hence, a quick, comprehensive, free and easy-to-use analysis tool is required. For this purpose, we developed a user-friendly web tool based on the R language. This tool provides ROC statistics, graphical tools, optimal cutpoint calculation, comparison of several markers, and sample size estimation to support researchers in their decisions without writing R codes. easyROC can be used via any device with an internet connection independently of the operating system. The web interface of easyROC is constructed with the R package shiny. This tool is freely available through www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC.",

In recent years, an increasing number of research projects in social and interdisciplinary sciences, including fields like innovation studies, scientometrics, economics, and network science have emphasized the role of diversification and sophistication of socioeconomic systems. However, so far no dedicated package exists that covers the needs of these emerging fields and interdisciplinary teams. Most packages about diversity tend to be created according to the demands and terminology of particular areas of natural and biological sciences. The package diverse uses interdisciplinary concepts of diversity—like variety, disparity and balance— as well as ubiquity and revealed comparative advantages, that are relevant to many fields of science, but are in particular useful for interdisciplinary research on diversity in socioeconomic systems. The package diverse provides a toolkit for social scientists, interdisciplinary researcher, and beginners in ecology to (i) import data, (ii) calculate different data transformations and normalization like revealed comparative advantages, (iii) calculate different diversity measures, and (iv) connect diverse to other specialized R packages on similarity measures, data visualization techniques, and statistical significance tests. The comprehensiveness of the package, from matrix import and transformations options, over similarity and diversity measures, to data visualization methods, makes it a useful package to explore different dimensions of diversity in complex systems.",

The Ake package is introduced for univariate density or probability mass function estimation and also for continuous and discrete regression functions using associated kernel estimators. These associated kernels have been proposed due to their specific features of variables of interest. The package focuses on associated kernel methods appropriate for continuous (bounded, positive) or discrete (count, categorical) data often found in applied settings. Furthermore, optimal bandwidths are selected by cross-validation for any associated kernel and by Bayesian methods for the binomial kernel. Other Bayesian methods for selecting bandwidths with other associated kernels will complete this package in its future versions; particularly, a Bayesian adaptive method for gamma kernel estimation of density functions is developed. Some practical and theoretical aspects of the normalizing constant in both density and probability mass functions estimations are given.",

    "description": "The crop water requirement is a key factor in the agricultural process. It is usually estimated throughout actual evapotranspiration (ETa ). This parameter is the key to develop irrigation strategies, to improve water use efficiency and to understand hydrological, climatic, and ecosystem processes. Currently, it is calculated with classical methods, which are difficult to extrapolate, or with land surface energy balance models (LSEB), such as METRIC and SEBAL, which are based on remote sensing data. This paper describes water, an open implementation of LSEB. The package provides several functions to estimate the parameters of the LSEB equation from satellite data and proposes a new object class to handle weather station data. One of the critical steps in METRIC is the selection of “cold” and “hot” pixels, which water solves with an automatic method. The water package can process a batch of satellite images and integrates most of the already published sub-models for METRIC. Although water implements METRIC, it will be expandable to SEBAL and others in the near future. Finally, two different procedures are demonstrated using data that is included in water package.",

    "description": "We briefly review SI units, and discuss R packages that deal with measurement units, their compatibility and conversion. Built upon udunits2 and the UNIDATA udunits library, we introduce the package units that provides a class for maintaining unit metadata. When used in expression, it automatically converts units, and simplifies units of results when possible; in case of incompatible units, errors are raised. The class flexibly allows expansion beyond predefined units. Using units may eliminate a whole class of potential scientific programming mistakes. We discuss the potential and limitations of computing with explicit units.",

    "description": "It is common for linear regression models to be plagued with the problem of multicollinearity when two or more regressors are highly correlated. This problem results in unstable estimates of regression coefficients and causes some serious problems in validation and interpretation of the model. Different diagnostic measures are used to detect multicollinearity among regressors. Many statistical software and R packages provide few diagnostic measures for the judgment of multicollinearity. Most widely used diagnostic measures in these software are: coefficient of determination (R2 ), variance inflation factor/tolerance limit (VIF/TOL), eigenvalues, condition number (CN) and condition index (CI) etc. In this manuscript, we present an R package, mctest, that computes popular and widely used multicollinearity diagnostic measures. The package also indicates which regressors may be the reason of collinearity among regressors.",

    "description": "Models of cancer progression provide insights on the order of accumulation of genetic alterations during cancer development. Algorithms to infer such models from the currently available mutational profiles collected from different cancer patients (cross-sectional data) have been defined in the literature since late the 90s. These algorithms differ in the way they extract a graphical model of the events modelling the progression, e.g., somatic mutations or copy-number alterations. TRONCO is an R package for TRanslational ONcology which provides a series of functions to assist the user in the analysis of cross-sectional genomic data and, in particular, it implements algorithms that aim to model cancer progression by means of the notion of selective advantage. These algorithms are proved to outperform the current state-of-the-art in the inference of cancer progression models. TRONCO also provides functionalities to load input cross-sectional data, set up the execution of the algorithms, assess the statistical confidence in the results, and visualize the models.

These include the classical approach to (symmetrical) correspondence analysis, singly ordered correspondence analysis, doubly ordered correspondence analysis, non symmetrical correspondence analysis, singly ordered non symmetrical correspondence analysis and doubly ordered non symmetrical correspondence analysis. The code provides the flexibility for constructing either a classical correspondence plot or a biplot graphical display. It also allows the user to consider other important features that allow to assess the reliability of the graphical representations, such as the inclusion of algebraically derived elliptical confidence regions. This paper provides R functions that elaborates more fully on the code presented in Beh and Lombardo (2014).",

We hereby describe ACSNMineR for calculation of enrichment or depletion of lists of genes of interest in biological pathways. ACSNMineR integrates ACSN molecular pathways gene sets, but can use any gene set encoded as a GMT file, for instance sets of genes available in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB).

The simulated correlated categorical responses are obtained by applying threshold approaches to correlated contin uous responses of underlying regression models and the dependence structure is parametrized in terms of the correlation matrix of the latent continuous responses. This article provides an elaborate introduction to the SimCorMultRes package demonstrating its design and usage via three examples. The package can be obtained via CRAN.",

    "description": "Social scientists and statisticians often use aggregate data to predict individual-level behavior because the latter are not always available. Various statistical techniques have been developed to make inferences from one level (e.g., precinct) to another level (e.g., individual voter) that minimize errors associated with ecological inference. While ecological inference has been shown to be highly problematic in a wide array of scientific fields, many political scientists and analysis employ the techniques when studying voting patterns. Indeed, federal voting rights lawsuits now require such an analysis, yet expert reports are not consistent in which type of ecological inference is used. This is especially the case in the analysis of racially polarized voting when there are multiple candidates and multiple racial groups. The eiCompare package was developed to easily assess two of the more common ecological inference methods: EI and EI:R×C. The package facilitates a seamless comparison between these methods so that scholars and legal practitioners can easily assess the two methods and whether they produce similar or disparate findings.",

    "description": "In analyzing data deriving from the administration of a questionnaire to a group of individu als, Item Response Theory (IRT) models provide a flexible framework to account for several aspects involved in the response process, such as the existence of multiple latent traits. In this paper, we focus on a class of semi-parametric multidimensional IRT models, in which these traits are represented through one or more discrete latent variables; these models allow us to cluster individuals into homo geneous latent classes and, at the same time, to properly study item characteristics. In particular, we follow a within-item multidimensional formulation similar to that adopted in the two-tier models, with each item measuring one or two latent traits. The proposed class of models may be estimated through the package MLCIRTwithin, whose functioning is illustrated in this paper with examples based on data about quality-of-life measurement and about the propensity to commit a crime.",

It is a collection of statistical methods for estimation and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. It focuses on providing confidence intervals and significance testing for (possibly many) low-dimensional subcomponents of the high-dimensional parameter vector. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment or policy variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model, for average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated (ATET), as well for extensions of these param eters to the endogenous setting are provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the penalization parameter in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors are implemented. Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for regression coefficients of a high-dimensional sparse regression are implemented. Data sets which have been used in the literature and might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing new estimators are included.",

Nowadays it is very relevant for researchers due to the fact that the knowledge extracted is simple and interesting. For this task, evolutionary fuzzy systems are well suited algorithms because they can find a good trade-off between multiple objectives in large search spaces. In fact, this paper presents the SDEFSR package, which contains all the evolutionary fuzzy systems for subgroup discovery presented throughout the literature. It is a package without dependencies on other software, providing functions with recommended default parameters. In addition, it brings a graphical user interface to avoid the user having to know all the parameters of the algorithms.",

In this paper, the TSdist package is presented, a complete tool which provides a unified framework to calculate the largest variety of time series dissimilarity measures available in R at the moment, to the best of our knowledge. The package implements some popular distance measures which were not previously available in R, and moreover, it also provides wrappers for measures already included in other R packages. Additionally, the application of these distance measures to clustering and classification tasks is also supported in TSdist, directly enabling the evaluation and comparison of their performance within these two frameworks.",

The matching between cases and controls must be broken when controls are to be used for other endpoints. A weighted analysis can then be performed to take care of the biased sampling from the cohort. We present the R package multipleNCC for reuse of controls in nested case-control studies by inverse probability weighting of the partial likelihood. The package handles right-censored, left-truncated and additionally matched data, and varying numbers of sampled controls and the whole analysis is carried out using one simple command. Four weight estimators are presented and variance estimation is explained. The package is illustrated by analyzing health survey data from three counties in Norway for two causes of death: cardiovascular disease and death from alcohol abuse, liver disease, and accidents and violence. The data set is included in the package.",

We develop fast, reliable basic probability functions (dinvgauss, pinvgauss, qinvgauss and rinvgauss) for the IGD that work for all possible parameter values and which achieve close to full machine accuracy. The most challenging task is to compute quantiles for given cumulative probabilities and we develop a simple but elegant mathematical solution to this problem. We show that Newton’s method for finding the quantiles of a IGD always converges monotonically when started from the mode of the distribution. Simple Taylor series expansions are used to improve accuracy on the log-scale. The IGD probability functions provide the same options and obey the same conventions as do probability functions provided in the stats package.",

For either meta-analysis or meta-regression it is possible to fit one of three models: standard normal random effect, t-distribution random effect or mixture of normal random effects. The latter two models allow for robustness by allowing for a random effect distribution with heavier tails than the normal distribution, and for both robust models the presence of outliers may be tested using the parametric bootstrap. For the mixture of normal random effects model the outlier studies may be identified through their posterior probability of membership in the outlier component of the mixture. Plots allow the results of the different models to be compared. The package is demonstrated on three examples: a meta-analysis with no outliers, a meta-analysis with an outlier and a meta-regression with an outlier.",

Various spatio-temporal covariance models have been implemented, such as the separable, product-sum, metric and sum-metric models.

The target variable of the application is the daily mean PM10 concentration measured at rural air quality monitoring stations across Germany in 2005. R code for variogram fitting and interpolation is presented in this paper to illustrate the workflow of spatio-temporal interpolation using gstat. We conclude that the system works properly and that the extension of gstat facilitates and eases spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and prediction for R users.",

    "description": "Finite mixture models are being used increasingly to model a wide variety of random phenomena for clustering, classification and density estimation. mclust is a powerful and popular package which allows modelling of data as a Gaussian finite mixture with different covariance structures and different numbers of mixture components, for a variety of purposes of analysis. Recently, version 5 of the package has been made available on CRAN. This updated version adds new covariance structures, dimension reduction capabilities for visualisation, model selection criteria, initialisation strategies for the EM algorithm, and bootstrap-based inference, making it a full-featured R package for data analysis via finite mixture modelling.",

    "description": "Web access logs contain information on HTTP(S) requests and form a key part of both industry and academic explorations of human behaviour on the internet. But the preparation (reading, parsing and manipulation) of that data is just unique enough to make generalized tools unfit for the task, both in programming time and processing time which are compounded when dealing with large data sets common with web access logs. In this paper we explain and demonstrate a series of packages designed to efficiently read in, parse and munge access log data, allowing researchers to handle URLs and IP addresses easily. These packages are substantially faster than existing R methods from a 3-500% speedup for file reading to a 57,000% speedup in URL parsing.",

The GMDH package has options to use different transfer functions (sigmoid, radial basis, polynomial, and tangent functions) simultaneously or separately. Data on cancer death rate of Pennsylvania from 1930 to 2000 are used to illustrate the features of the GMDH package.

    "description": "Interest in social network analysis has exploded in the past few years, partly thanks to the advancements in statistical methods and computing for network analysis. A wide range of the methods for network analysis is already covered by existent R packages. However, no comprehensive packages are available to calculate group centrality scores and to identify key players (i.e., those players who constitute the most central group) in a network. These functionalities are important because, for example, many social and health interventions rely on key players to facilitate the intervention. Identifying key players is challenging because players who are individually the most central are not necessarily the most central as a group due to redundancy in their connections. In this paper we develop methods and tools for computing group centrality scores and for identifying key players in social networks. We illustrate the methods using both simulated and empirical examples. The package keyplayer providing the presented methods is available from Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

    "description": "The general clustering algorithms do not guarantee optimality because of the hardness of the problem. Polynomial-time methods can find the clustering corresponding to the exact optimum only in special cases. For example, the dynamic programming algorithm can solve the one-dimensional clustering problem, i.e., when the items to be clustered can be characterised by only one scalar number. Optimal one-dimensional clustering is provided by package Ckmeans.1d.dp in R. The paper shows a possible generalisation of the method implemented in this package to multidimensional data: the dynamic programming method can be applied to find the optimum clustering of vectors when only subsequent items may form a cluster. Sequential data are common in various fields including telecommunication, bioinformatics, marketing, transportation etc. The proposed algorithm can determine the optima for a range of cluster numbers in order to support the case when the number of clusters is not known in advance.",

Though many clustering evaluation techniques have been developed to solve this problem, the recently developed algorithm Progeny Clustering is a much faster alternative and one that is relevant to biomedical applications. In this paper, we introduce an R package progenyClust that implements and extends the original Progeny Clustering algorithm for evaluating clustering stability and identifying the optimal cluster number. We illustrate its applicability using two examples: a simulated test dataset for proof-of-concept, and a cell imaging dataset for demonstrating its application potential in biomedical research. The progenyClust package is versatile in that it offers great flexibility for picking methods and tuning parameters. In addition, the default parameter setting as well as the plot and summary methods offered in the package make the application of Progeny Clustering straightforward and coherent.",

    "description": "In recent years, the cost of DNA sequencing has decreased at a rate that has outpaced improvements in memory capacity. It is now common to collect or have access to many gigabytes of biological sequences. This has created an urgent need for approaches that analyze sequences in subsets without requiring all of the sequences to be loaded into memory at one time. It has also opened opportunities to improve the organization and accessibility of information acquired in sequencing projects. The DECIPHER package offers solutions to these problems by assisting in the curation of large sets of biological sequences stored in compressed format inside a database. This approach has many practical advantages over standard bioinformatics workflows, and enables large analyses that would otherwise be prohibitively time consuming.",

To this end, it is necessary to determine the best subset of q (q ≤ p) predictors which will establish the model with the best prediction capacity. FWDselect package introduces a new forward stepwise based selection procedure to select the best model in different regression frameworks (parametric or nonparametric). The developed methodology, which can be equally applied to linear models, generalized linear models or generalized additive models, aims to introduce solutions to the following two topics: i) selection of the best combination of q variables by using a step-by-step method; and, perhaps, most importantly, ii) search for the number of covariates to be included in the model based on bootstrap resampling techniques.

This article describes hiddenf, an R package that enables users to quantify and characterize a certain form of interaction in two-factor layouts. When effects of one factor (a) fall into two groups depending on the level of another factor, and (b) are constant within these groups, the interaction pattern is deemed \"hidden additivity\" because within groups, the effects of the two factors are additive, while between groups the factors are allowed to interact. The hiddenf software can be used to estimate, test, and report an appropriate factorial effects model corresponding to hidden additivity, which is intermediate between the unavailable full factorial model and the overly-simplistic additive model. Further, the software also conducts five statistical tests for interaction proposed between 1949 and 2014. A collection of 17 datasets is used for illustration.",

Chi-square, Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Jarque-Bera goodness-of-fit procedures are provided along with cryptographic randomness tests. CryptRndTest utilizes multiple precision floating numbers for sequences longer than 64-bit based on the package Rmpfr. By this way, included tests are applied precisely for higher bit-lengths. In addition CryptRndTest provides a user friendly interface to these cryptographic randomness tests. As an illustrative application, CryptRndTest is used to test available random number generators in R.",

The package include two functions for the generation of K 2×2 tables over product-multinomial sampling schemes and that of 2×2×K tables under Poisson or multinomial sampling plans. It also contains two functions that generate R×C tables under product-multinomial, multinomial or Poisson sampling plans with or without intraclass correlations. The package also includes a function for random number generation from a given probability distribution. In addition to the contingency table format, the package also provides raw data required for further estimation purposes.",

    "title": "Stylometry with R: A Package for Computational Text Analysis",
    "description": "This software paper describes ‘Stylometry with R’ (stylo), a flexible R package for the high level analysis of writing style in stylometry. Stylometry (computational stylistics) is concerned with the quantitative study of writing style, e.g. authorship verification, an application which has considerable potential in forensic contexts, as well as historical research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can benefit from our implementation of a series of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of similarity metrics.",

    "title": "Generalized Hermite Distribution Modelling with the R Package hermite",
    "description": "The Generalized Hermite distribution (and the Hermite distribution as a particular case) is often used for fitting count data in the presence of overdispersion or multimodality. Despite this, to our knowledge, no standard software packages have implemented specific functions to compute basic probabilities and make simple statistical inference based on these distributions. We present here a set of computational tools that allows the user to face these difficulties by modelling with the Generalized Hermite distribution using the R package hermite. The package can also be used to generate random deviates from a Generalized Hermite distribution and to use basic functions to compute probabilities (density, cumulative density and quantile functions are available), to estimate parameters using the maximum likelihood method and to perform the likelihood ratio test for Poisson assumption against a Generalized Hermite alternative. In order to improve the density and quantile functions performance when the parameters are large, Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions have been used. Hermite regression is also a useful tool for modeling inflated count data, so its inclusion to a commonly used software like R will make this tool available to a wide range of potential users. Some examples of usage in several fields of application are also given.",

It is designed primarily for use by instructors of undergraduate and graduate-level open-channel hydrodynamics courses in such diverse fields as river engineering, physical geography and geophysics. The governing equations used to describe open-channel flows are briefly presented, followed by example applications. These include the computation of gradually varied flows and two examples of unsteady flows in channels—namely, the tracking of the evolution of a flood wave in a channel and the prediction of extreme variation in the water-surface profile that results when a sluice gate is abruptly closed. Model results for the unsteady flow examples are validated against standard benchmarks. The article concludes with a discussion of potential modifications and extensions to the package.",

    "title": "scmamp: Statistical Comparison of Multiple Algorithms in Multiple Problems",
    "description": "Comparing the results obtained by two or more algorithms in a set of problems is a central task in areas such as machine learning or optimization. Drawing conclusions from these comparisons may require the use of statistical tools such as hypothesis testing. There are some interesting papers that cover this topic. In this manuscript we present scmamp, an R package aimed at being a tool that simplifies the whole process of analyzing the results obtained when comparing algorithms, from loading the data to the production of plots and tables. Comparing the performance of different algorithms is an essential step in many research and practical computational works. When new algorithms are proposed, they have to be compared with the state of the art. Similarly, when an algorithm is used for a particular problem, its performance with different sets of parameters has to be compared, in order to tune them for the best results. When the differences are very clear (e.g., when an algorithm is the best in all the problems used in the comparison), the direct comparison of the results may be enough. However, this is an unusual situation and, thus, in most situations a direct comparison may be misleading and not enough to draw sound conclusions; in those cases, the statistical assessment of the results is advisable. The statistical comparison of algorithms in the context of machine learning has been covered in several papers. In particular, the tools implemented in this package are those presented in Demšar (2006); García and Herrera (2008); García et al. (2010). Another good review that covers, among other aspects, the statistical assessment of the results in the context of supervised classification can be found in Santafé et al. (2015).",

The package is focussed on efficient and accurate evaluation of the Gauss hypergeometric function over the whole of the complex plane within the constraints of fixed-precision arithmetic. The hypergeometric series is convergent only within the unit circle, so analytic continuation must be used to define the function outside the unit circle. This short document outlines the numerical and conceptual methods used in the package; and justifies the package philosophy, which is to maintain transparent and verifiable links between the software and Abramowitz and Stegun (1965). Most of the package functionality is accessed via the single function hypergeo(), which dispatches to one of several methods depending on the value of its arguments. The package is demonstrated in the context of game theory.",

    "description": "Code analysis tools are crucial to understand program behavior. Profile tools use the results of time measurements in the execution of a program to gain this understanding and thus help in the optimization of the code. In this paper, we review the different available packages to profile R code and show the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. In additon, we present GUIProfiler, a package that fulfills some unmet needs. Package GUIProfiler generates an HTML report with the timing for each code line and the relationships between different functions. This package mimics the behavior of the MATLAB profiler. The HTML report includes information on the time spent on each of the lines of the profiled code (the slowest code is highlighted). If the package is used within the RStudio environment, the user can navigate across the bottlenecks in the code and open the editor to modify the lines of code where more time is spent. It is also possible to edit the code using Notepad++ (a free editor for Windows) by simply clicking on the corresponding line. The graphical user interface makes it easy to identify the specific lines which slow down the code. The integration in RStudio and the generation of an HTML report makes GUIProfiler a very convenient tool to perform code optimization.",

The first is a subset of important variables including some redundancy which can be relevant for interpretation, and the second one is a smaller subset corresponding to a model trying to avoid redundancy focusing more closely on the prediction objective. The two-stage strategy is based on a preliminary ranking of the explanatory variables using the random forests permutation-based score of importance and proceeds using a stepwise forward strategy for variable introduction. The two proposals can be obtained automatically using data-driven default values, good enough to provide interesting results, but strategy can also be tuned by the user. The algorithm is illustrated on a simulated example and its applications to real datasets are presented.",

    "description": "Along with increased complexity of the models used for scientific activities and engineering come diverse and greater uncertainties. Today, effectively quantifying the uncertainties contained in a model appears to be more important than ever. Scientific fellows know how serious it is to calibrate their model in a robust way, and decision-makers describe how critical it is to keep the best effort to reduce the uncertainties about the model. Effectively accessing the uncertainties about the model requires mastering all the tasks involved in the numerical experiments, from optimizing the experimental design to managing the very time consuming aspect of model simulation and choosing the adequate indicators and analysis methods. In this paper, we present an open framework for organizing the complexity associated with numerical model simulation and analyses. Named mtk (Mexico Toolkit), the developed system aims at providing practitioners from different disciplines with a systematic and easy way to compare and to find the best method to effectively uncover and quantify the uncertainties contained in the model and further to evaluate their impact on the performance of the model. Such requirements imply that the system must be generic, universal, homogeneous, and extensible. This paper discusses such an implementation using the R scientific computing platform and demonstrates its functionalities with examples from agricultural modeling. The package mtk is of general purpose and easy to extend. Numerous methods are already available in the actual release version, including Fast, Sobol, Morris, Basic Monte-Carlo, Regression, LHS (Latin Hypercube Sampling), PLMM (Polynomial Linear metamodel). Most of them are compiled from available R packages with extension tools delivered by package mtk.",

This package takes the generalized linear model approach to ALT planning, because this approach can easily handle censoring plans and derive information matrices for evaluating designs. Three types of optimality criteria are considered: D-optimality for model parameter estimation, U-optimality for reliability prediction at a single use condition, and I-optimality for reliability prediction over a region of use conditions. The Weibull distribution is assumed for failure time data and more than one stress factor can be specified in the package. Several graphical evaluation tools are also provided for the comparison of different ALT test plans.",

    "description": "A simple temporal point process (SPP) is an important class of time series, where the sample realization of the process is solely composed of the times at which events occur. Particular examples of point process data are neuronal spike patterns or spike trains, and a large number of distance and similarity metrics for those data have been proposed. A marked point process (MPP) is an extension of a simple temporal point process, in which a certain vector valued mark is associated with each of the temporal points in the SPP. Analyses of MPPs are of practical importance because instances of MPPs include recordings of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes. In this paper, we introduce the R package mmpp, which implements a number of distance and similarity metrics for SPPs, and also extends those metrics for dealing with MPPs.",

    "description": "Most classification algorithms deal with datasets which have a set of input features, the variables to be used as predictors, and only one output class, the variable to be predicted. However, in late years many scenarios in which the classifier has to work with several outputs have come to life. Automatic labeling of text documents, image annotation or protein classification are among them. Multilabel datasets are the product of these new needs, and they have many specific traits. The mldr package allows the user to load datasets of this kind, obtain their characteristics, produce specialized plots, and manipulate them. The goal is to provide the exploratory tools needed to analyze multilabel datasets, as well as the transformation and manipulation functions that will make possible to apply binary and multiclass classification models to this data or the development of new multilabel classifiers. Thanks to its integrated user interface, the exploratory functions will be available even to non-specialized R users.",

These dissimilarities arise from a set of classification or regression trees, one with each variable in the data acting in turn as a the response, and all others as predictors. This use of trees produces dissim ilarities that are insensitive to scaling, benefit from automatic variable selection, and appear to perform well. The software allows a number of options to be set, affecting the set of objects returned in the call; the user can also specify a clustering algorithm and, optionally, return only the clustering vector. The package can also generate a numeric data set whose inter-point distances relate to the treeClust ones; such a numeric data set can be much smaller than the vector of inter-point dissimilarities, a useful feature in big data sets.",

CAR() and SAR() families for con ditional and simultaneous autoregressive random effects were implemented. Eigen decomposition of the matrix describing the spatial structure (e.g., the neighborhood matrix) was used to transform the CAR/SAR random effects into an independent, but heteroscedastic, Gaussian random effect. A linear predictor is fitted for the random effect variance to estimate the parameters in the CAR and SAR models. This gives a computationally efficient algorithm for moderately sized problems.",

When the problem instance being solved is defined by several parameters, assessing a number of methods with respect to many problem configurations simultaneously becomes a hard task. Some visualization technique is required for presenting a large number of statistical significance results in an easily interpretable way. Here we review an existing color-based approach called Statistical Ranking Color Scheme (SRCS) for displaying the results of multiple pairwise statistical comparisons between several methods assessed separately on a number of problem configurations. We introduce an R package implementing SRCS, which performs all the pairwise statistical tests from user data and generates customizable plots. We demonstrate its applicability on two examples from the areas of dynamic optimization and machine learning, in which several algorithms are compared on many problem instances, each defined by a combination of parameters.",

They return a sample of parameter values which produce simulations close to the observed dataset. A standard approach is to reduce the simulated and observed datasets to vectors of summary statistics and accept when the difference between these is below a specified threshold. ABC can also be adapted to perform model choice. In this article, we present a new software package for R, abctools which provides methods for tuning ABC algorithms. This includes recent dimension reduction algorithms to tune the choice of summary statistics, and coverage methods to tune the choice of threshold. We provide several illustrations of these routines on applications taken from the ABC literature.",

    "description": "The beta distribution is a versatile function that accommodates a broad range of probability distribution shapes. Beta regression based on the beta distribution can be used to model a response variable y that takes values in open unit interval (0, 1). Zero/one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression models can be applied when y takes values from closed unit interval [0, 1]. The ZOIB model is based a piecewise distribution that accounts for the probability mass at 0 and 1, in addition to the probability density within (0, 1). This paper introduces an R package – zoib that provides Bayesian inferences for a class of ZOIB models. The statistical methodology underlying the zoib package is discussed, the functions covered by the package are outlined, and the usage of the package is illustrated with three examples of different data and model types. The package is comprehensive and versatile in that it can model data with or without inflation at 0 or 1, accommodate clustered and correlated data via latent variables, perform penalized regression as needed, and allow for model comparison via the computation of the DIC criterion.",

Moreover, quantitative isother mal amplification (qIA) methods have become more prominent in life sciences and point-of-care diagnostics. Additionally, the analysis of melting data is essential during many experiments. Several software packages have been developed for the analysis of such datasets. In most cases, the software is either distributed as closed source software or as monolithic block with little freedom to perform highly customized analysis procedures. We argue, among others, that R is an excellent foundation for reproducible and transparent data analysis in a highly customizable cross-platform environment. However, for novices it is often challenging to master R or learn capabilities of the vast number of packages available. In the paper, we describe exemplary workflows for the analysis of qPCR, qIA or dPCR experiments including the analysis of melting curve data. Our analysis relies entirely on R packages available from public repositories. Additionally, we provide information related to standardized and reproducible research.",

It aims to establish a typology of the external variables and a typology of the events from their mutual relationships. In order to do so, the influence of external variables on the lexical choices is untangled cancelling the associations among them, and to avoid the instability issued from multicollinearity, they are substituted by their principal components. The CaGalt function, implemented in the FactoMineR package, provides numerous numerical and graphical outputs. Confidence ellipses are also provided to validate and improve the representation of words and variables. Although this methodology was developed mainly to give an answer to the problem of analyzing open-ended questions, it can be applied to any kind of frequency/contingency table with external variables.",

    "description": "Visual analysis of data is important to understand the main characteristics, main trends and relationships in data sets and it can be used to assess the data quality. Using the R package sparkTable, statistical tables holding quantitative information can be enhanced by including spark-type graphs such as sparklines and sparkbars . These kind of graphics are well-known in literature and are considered as simple, intense and illustrative graphs that are small enough to fit in a single line. Thus, they can easily enrich tables and texts with additional information in a comprehensive visual way. The R package sparkTable uses a clean S4 class design and provides methods to create different types of sparkgraphs that can be used in websites, presentations and documents. We also implemented an easy way for non-experts to create highly complex tables. In this case, graphical parameters can be interactively changed, variables can be sorted, graphs can be added and removed in an interactive manner. Thereby it is possible to produce custom-tailored graphical tables – standard tables that are enriched with graphs – that can be displayed in a browser and exported to various formats.",

With the use of these tools, a model object’s predict method could return estimable predictions as-is while flagging non-estimable ones in some way, so that the user can know which predictions to believe. The estimability package also provides, as a demonstration, an estimability-enhanced epredict method to use in place of predict for models fitted using the stats package.",

    "description": "Data from complex survey designs require special consideration with regard to estimation of finite population parameters and corresponding variance estimation procedures, as a consequence of significant departures from the simple random sampling assumption. In the past decade a number of statistical software packages have been developed to facilitate the analysis of complex survey data. All these statistical software packages are able to treat samples selected from one sampling frame containing all population units. Dual frame surveys are very useful when it is not possible to guarantee a complete coverage of the target population and may result in considerable cost savings over a single frame design with comparable precision. There are several estimators available in the statistical literature but no existing software covers dual frame estimation procedures. This gap is now filled by package Frames2. In this paper we highlight the main features of the package. The package includes the main estimators in dual frame surveys and also provides interval confidence estimation.",

However, it is rarely shown in research papers due to the difficulties in nonparametric estimation. We developed the bshazard package to facilitate the computation of a nonparametric estimate of the hazard function, with data-driven smoothing. The method accounts for left truncation, right censoring and possible covariates. B-splines are used to estimate the shape of the hazard within the generalized linear mixed models framework. Smoothness is controlled by imposing an autoregressive structure on the baseline hazard coefficients. This perspective allows an ’automatic’ smoothing by avoiding the need to choose the smoothing parameter, which is estimated from the data as a dispersion parameter. A simulation study demonstrates the capability of our software and an application to estimate the hazard of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Swedish population data shows its potential.",

The functions are flexible, computationally efficient, and compatible with uniaxial or triaxial data. The package nhanesaccel is specifically for processing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), years 2003–2006. Its primary function generates measures of PA volume, intensity, frequency, and patterns according to user-specified data processing methods. This function can process the NHANES 2003-2006 dataset in under one minute, which is a drastic improve ment over existing software.

    "description": "Assessing the assumption of multivariate normality is required by many parametric mul tivariate statistical methods, such as MANOVA, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, canonical correlation, etc. It is important to assess multivariate normality in order to proceed with such statistical methods. There are many analytical methods proposed for checking multivariate normality. However, deciding which method to use is a challenging process, since each method may give different results under certain conditions. Hence, we may say that there is no best method, which is valid under any condition, for normality checking. In addition to numerical results, it is very useful to use graphical methods to decide on multivariate normality. Combining the numerical results from several methods with graphical approaches can be useful and provide more reliable decisions. Here, we present an R package, MVN, to assess multivariate normality. It contains the three most widely used multivariate normality tests, including Mardia’s, Henze-Zirkler’s and Royston’s, and graphical approaches, including chi-square Q-Q, perspective and contour plots. It also includes two multivariate outlier detection methods, which are based on robust Mahalanobis distances. Moreover, this package offers functions to check the univariate normality of marginal distributions through both tests and plots. Furthermore, especially for non-R users, we provide a user-friendly web application of the package. This application is available at http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/MVN/.",

    "description": "Q is a methodology to explore the distinct subjective perspectives that exist within a group. It is used increasingly across disciplines. The methodology is semi-qualitative and the data are analysed using data reduction methods to discern the existing patterns of thought. This package is the first to perform Q analysis in R, and it provides many advantages to the existing software: namely, it is fully cross-platform, the algorithms can be transparently examined, it provides results in a clearly structured and tabulated form ready for further exploration and modelling, it produces a graphical summary of the results, and it generates a more concise report of the distinguishing and consensus statements. This paper introduces the methodology and explains how to use the package, its advantages as well as its limitations. I illustrate the main functions with a dataset on value patterns about democracy.",

It is the first R package that targets specifically at the group sequential test of equivalence hypotheses. The exact test approach adopted by gset neither assumes the large-sample normality of the test statistics nor ignores the contribution to the overall Type I error rate from rejecting one out of the two one-sided hypotheses under a null value. The features of gset include: error spending functions, computation of equivalence boundaries and futility boundaries, either binding or nonbinding, depiction of stagewise boundary plots, and operating characteristics of a given group sequential design including empirical Type I error rate, empirical power, expected sample size, and probability of stopping at an interim look due to equivalence or futility.",

The principal aim of this package is to implement SGoF-type multiple testing methods, known to be more powerful than the classical false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error rate (FWER) based methods in certain situations, particularly when the number of tests is large. This package includes Bi nomial and Conservative SGoF and the Bayesian and Beta-Binomial SGoF multiple testing procedures, which are adaptations of the original SGoF method to the Bayesian setting and to possibly correlated tests, respectively. The sgof package also implements the Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR controlling procedures. For each method the package provides (among other things) the number of rejected null hypotheses, estimation of the corresponding FDR, and the set of adjusted p values. Some automatic plots of interest are implemented too. Two real data examples are used to illustrate how sgof works.",

    "title": "Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies with R ",
    "description": "This paper outlines how to conduct a simple meta-analysis of neuroimaging foci of activation in R. In particular, the first part of this paper reviews the nature of fMRI data, and briefly overviews the existing packages that can be used to analyze fMRI data in R. The second part illustrates how to handle fMRI data by showing how to visualize the results of different neuroimaging studies in a so-called orthographic view, where the spatial distribution of the foci of activation from different fMRI studies can be inspected visually. Functional MRI (fMRI) is one of the most important and powerful tools of neuroscientific research. Although not as commonly used for fMRI analysis as some specific applications such as SPM (Friston et al., 2006), AFNI (Cox and Hyde, 1997), or FSL (Smith et al., 2004), R does provide several packages that can be employed in neuroimaging research. These packages deal with a variety of topics, ranging from reading and manipulating fMRI datasets, to implementing sophisticated statistical models. The goal of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to fMRI analysis, and the various R packages that can be used to carry it out. As an example, it will show how to use simple R commands to read fMRI images and plot results from previous studies, which can then be visually compared. This is a special form of meta-analysis, and a common way to compare results from the existing literature.",

In this instance, numerical integration will usually be the only way forward. However, for autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in one or two dimensions, it is possible to employ an instructive qualitative analysis foregoing this requirement, using so-called phase plane methods. Moreover, this qualitative analysis can even prove to be highly useful for systems that can be solved analytically, or will be solved numerically anyway. The package phaseR allows the user to perform such phase plane analyses: determining the stability of any equilibrium points easily, and producing informative plots.",

Whereas a great deal of focus has been placed in the development of software tools that aid researchers develop simulations, similar focus has not been applied in the creation of tools that perform a rigorous statistical analysis of results generated through simulation: vital in understanding how these results offer an insight into the captured system. This encouraged us to develop spartan, a package of statistical techniques designed to assist researchers in understanding the relationship between their simulation and the real system. Previously we have described each technique within spartan in detail, with an accompanying immunology case study examining the development of lymphoid tissue. Here we provide a practical introduction to the package, demonstrating how each technique is run in R, to assist researchers in integrating this package alongside their chosen simulation platform.",

Typically, the leading principal components are used to understand the variation in the data or to reduce the dimension of the data for subsequent analysis. The remaining principal components are ignored since they explain little of the variation in the data. However, the space spanned by the low variation principal components may contain interesting structure, structure that PCA cannot find. Prinsimp is an R package that looks for interesting structure of low variability. “Interesting” is defined in terms of a simplicity measure. Looking for interpretable structure in a low variability space has particular importance in evolutionary biology, where such structure can signify the existence of a genetic constraint.",

The article motivates the benefit of such a conversion with an example Table, followed by a short user manual, which includes a comparison between the simple one argument call to TableToLongForm, with code for an equivalent manual conversion. The article then explores the types of Tables the package can convert by providing a gallery of all recognised patterns.

The oligoMask package is an R/SQLite framework which can utilize publicly available genetic variants and works in conjunction with the oligo package to read in the expression data and remove microarray probes which are likely to impact a given microarray experiment prior to analysis. Tools are provided for creating an SQLite database containing the probe and variant annotations and for performing the commonly used RMA preprocessing procedure for Affymetrix microarrays.

    "description": "Comparing text strings in terms of distance functions is a common and fundamental task in many statistical text-processing applications. Thus far, string distance functionality has been somewhat scattered around R and its extension packages, leaving users with inconistent interfaces and encoding handling. The stringdist package was designed to offer a low-level interface to several popular string distance algorithms which have been re-implemented in C for this purpose. The package offers distances based on counting q-grams, edit-based distances, and some lesser known heuristic distance functions. Based on this functionality, the package also offers inexact matching equivalents of R’s native exact matching functions match and %in%.",

The core of the package are the four distribution functions dwiener, pwiener, qwiener and rwiener, which use up-to-date methods, implemented in C, and provide fast and accurate computation of the density, distribution, and quantile function, as well as a random number generator for the Wiener diffusion model. We used the typical Wiener diffusion model with four parameters: boundary separation, non-decision time, initial bias and drift rate parameter. Beyond the distribution functions, we provide extended likelihood-based functions that can be used for parameter estimation and model selection. The package can be obtained via CRAN.",

Traditional methods for analyzing the association between categorical variables are not appropriate with MRCVs due to the within-subject dependence among responses. We have developed the MRCV package as the first R package available to correctly analyze MRCV data. Statistical methods offered by our package include counterparts to traditional Pearson chi-square tests for independence and loglinear models, where bootstrap methods and Rao-Scott adjustments are relied on to obtain valid inferences. We demonstrate the primary functions within the package by analyzing data from a survey assessing the swine waste management practices of Kansas farmers.",

For example, an individual may deliberately attempt to manipulate or distort responses to simulate grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms in order to reach specific goals such as, for example, obtaining financial compensation, avoiding being charged with a crime, avoiding military duty, or obtaining drugs. This article introduces the package sgr that can be used to perform fake data analysis according to the sample generation by replacement approach. The package includes functions for making simple inferences about discrete/ordinal fake data. The package allows to quantify uncertainty in inferences based on possible fake data as well as to study the implications of fake data for empirical results.",

Computer scientists have developed streaming applications such as Storm and the S4 distributed stream computing platform1 to deal with data streams. However, in current production packages testing and evaluating streaming algorithms is cumbersome. This paper presents RStorm for the development and evaluation of streaming algorithms analogous to these production packages, but implemented fully in R. RStorm allows developers of streaming algorithms to quickly test, iterate, and evaluate various implementations of streaming algorithms. The paper provides both a canonical computer science example, the streaming word count, and examples of several statistical applications of RStorm.",

With pitchRx, one can easily obtain and store Gameday data in a remote database. The Gameday website hosts a wealth of XML data, but perhaps most interesting is PITCHf/x. Among other things, PITCHf/x data can be used to recreate a baseball’s flight path from a pitcher’s hand to home plate. With pitchRx, one can easily create animations and interactive 3D scatterplots of the baseball’s flight path. PITCHf/x data is also commonly used to generate a static plot of baseball locations at the moment they cross home plate. These plots, sometimes called strike-zone plots, can also refer to a plot of event probabilities over the same region. pitchRx provides an easy and robust way to generate strike-zone plots using the ggplot2 package.",

    "description": "Interval censored outcomes arise when a silent event of interest is known to have occurred within a specific time period determined by the times of the last negative and first positive diagnostic tests. There is a rich literature on parametric and non-parametric approaches for the analysis of interval-censored outcomes. A commonly used strategy is to use a proportional hazards (PH) model with the baseline hazard function parameterized. The proportional hazards assumption can be relaxed in stratified models by allowing the baseline hazard function to vary across strata defined by a subset of explanatory variables. In this paper, we describe and implement a new R package straweib, for fitting a stratified Weibull model appropriate for interval censored outcomes. We illustrate the R package straweib by analyzing data from a longitudinal oral health study on the timing of the emergence of permanent teeth in 4430 children.",

Ranking data are modeled by the Insertion Sorting Rank (ISR) model, which is a meaningful model parametrized by a central ranking and a dispersion parameter. A conditional independence assumption allows multivariate rankings to be taken into account, and clustering is performed by means of mixtures of multivariate ISR models. The parameters of the cluster (central rankings and dispersion parameters) help the practitioners to interpret the clustering. Moreover, the Rankcluster package provides an estimate of the missing ranking positions when rankings are partial. After an overview of the mixture of multivariate ISR models, the Rankcluster package is described and its use is illustrated through the analysis of two real datasets.",

The Beta-Skew-t-EGARCH model is a dynamic model of the scale or volatility of financial returns. The model is characterised by its robustness to jumps or outliers, and by its exponential specification of volatility. The latter enables richer dynamics, since parameters need not be restricted to be positive to ensure positivity of volatility. In addition, the model also allows for heavy tails and skewness in the conditional return (i.e. scaled return), and for leverage and a time-varying long-term component in the volatility specification. More generally, the model can be viewed as a model of the scale of the error in a dynamic regression.",

Both schools of thought are interested in the parsimonious presentation of sufficient information to enable readers to evaluate the significance of contrasts resulting from the inclusion of qualitative variables in GLMs. These comparisons also arise when trying to interpret multinomial models where one category of the dependent variable is omitted as a reference. While considerable advances have been made, opportunities remain to improve the presentation of this information, especially in graphical form.

    "description": "There is a lack of robust statistical analyses for random effects linear models. In practice, statistical analyses, including estimation, prediction and inference, are not reliable when data are unbalanced, of small size, contain outliers, or not normally distributed. It is fortunate that rank-based regression analysis is a robust nonparametric alternative to likelihood and least squares analysis. We propose an R package that calculates rank-based statistical analyses for twoand three-level random effects nested designs. In this package, a new algorithm which recursively obtains robust predictions for both scale and random effects is used, along with three rank-based fitting methods.",

This article covers methods, implemented in the MBmca package, for DNA Melting Curve Analysis on microbead surfaces. Particularly, the use of the second derivative melting peaks is suggested as an additional parameter to characterize the melting behavior of DNA duplexes.

    "description": "Comparing two proportions through the difference is a basic problem in statistics and has applications in many fields. More than twenty confidence intervals (Newcombe, 1998a,b) have been proposed. Most of them are approximate intervals with an asymptotic infimum coverage probability much less than the nominal level. In addition, large sample may be costly in practice. So exact optimal confidence intervals become critical for drawing valid statistical inference with accuracy and precision. Recently, Wang (2010, 2012) derived the exact smallest (optimal) one-sided 1 − α confidence intervals for the difference of two paired or independent proportions. His intervals, however, are computer-intensive by nature. In this article, we provide an R package ExactCIdiff to implement the intervals when the sample size is not large. This would be the first available package in R to calculate the exact confidence intervals for the difference of proportions. Exact two-sided 1 − α interval can be easily obtained by taking the intersection of the lower and upper one-sided 1 − α/2 intervals. Readers may jump to Examples 1 and 2 to obtain these intervals.",

    "description": "The ability to implement statistical models in the BUGS language facilitates Bayesian in ference by automating MCMC algorithms. Software packages that interpret the BUGS language include OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, and JAGS. R packages that link BUGS software to the R environment, including rjags and R2WinBUGS, are widely used in Bayesian analysis. Indeed, many packages in the Bayesian task view on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html) depend on this integration. However, the R and BUGS languages use different representations of common probability density functions, creating a potential for errors to occur in the implementation or interpre tation of analyses that use both languages. Here we review different parameterizations used by the R and BUGS languages, describe how to translate between the languages, and provide an R function, r2bugs.distributions, that transforms parameterizations from R to BUGS and back again.",

R packages for different stochastic methods such as genetic algorithms and differential evolution have been developed and successfully used in the R community. Based on Tsallis statistics, the R package GenSA was developed for generalized simulated annealing to process complicated non-linear objective functions with a large number of local minima. In this paper we provide a brief introduction to the R package and demonstrate its utility by solving a non-convex portfolio optimization problem in finance and the Thomson problem in physics. GenSA is useful and can serve as a complementary tool to, rather than a replacement for, other widely used R packages for optimization.",

    "title": "Multiple Factor Analysis for Contingency Tables in the FactoMineR Package",
    "description": "We present multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACT) and its implementation in the FactoMineR package. This method, through an option of the MFA function, allows us to deal with multiple contingency or frequency tables, in addition to the categorical and quantitative multiple tables already considered in previous versions of the package. Thanks to this revised function, either a multiple contingency table or a mixed multiple table integrating quantitative, categorical and frequency data can be tackled. The FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008; Husson et al., 2011) offers the most commonly used principal component methods: principal component analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA; Benzécri, 1973), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA; Lebart et al., 2006) and multiple factor analysis (MFA; Escofier and Pagès, 2008). Detailed presentations of these methods enriched by numerous examples can be consulted at the website http://factominer.free.fr/. An extension of the MFA function that considers contingency or frequency tables as proposed by Bécue-Bertaut and Pagès (2004, 2008) is detailed in this article. First, an example is presented in order to motivate the approach. Next, the mortality data used to illustrate the method are introduced. Then we briefly describe multiple factor analysis (MFA) and present the principles of its extension to contingency tables. A real example on mortality data illustrates the handling of the MFA function to analyse these multiple tables and, finally, conclusions are presented.",

    "description": "Blind people have experienced access issues to many software applications since the advent of the Windows operating system; statistical software has proven to follow the rule and not be an exception. The ability to use R within minutes of download with next to no adaptation has opened doors for accessible production of statistical analyses for this author (himself blind) and blind students around the world. This article shows how little is required to make R the most accessible statistical software available today. There is any number of ramifications that this opportunity creates for blind students, especially in terms of their future research and employment prospects. There is potential for making R even better for blind users. The extensibility of R makes this possible through added functionality being made available in an add-on package called BrailleR. Functions in this package are intended to make graphical information available in text form.",

    "title": "stellaR: A Package to Manage Stellar Evolution Tracks and Isochrones",
    "description": "We present the R package stellaR, which is designed to access and manipulate publicly available stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones from the Pisa low-mass database. The procedures for extracting important stages in the evolution of a star from the database, for constructing isochrones from stellar tracks and for interpolating among tracks are discussed and demonstrated. Due to the advance in the instrumentation, nowadays astronomers can deal with a huge amount of high-quality observational data. In the last decade impressive improvements of spectroscopic and photometric observational capabilities made available data which stimulated the research in the glob ular clusters field. The theoretical effort of recovering the evolutionary history of the clusters benefits from the computation of extensive databases of stellar tracks and isochrones, such as Pietrinferni et al. (2006); Dotter et al. (2008); Bertelli et al. (2008). We recently computed a large data set of stellar tracks and isochrones, “The Pisa low-mass database” (Dell’Omodarme et al., 2012), with up to date physical and chemical inputs, and made available all the calculations to the astrophysical community at the Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS)1 , a data center dedicated to the collection and worldwide distribution of astronomical data. In most databases, the management of the information and the extraction of the relevant evolu tionary properties from libraries of tracks and/or isochrones is the responsibility of the end users. Due to its extensive capabilities of data manipulation and analysis, however, R is an ideal choice for these tasks. Nevertheless R is not yet well known in astrophysics; up to December 2012 only seven astronomical or astrophysical-oriented packages have been published on CRAN (see the CRAN Task View Chemometrics and Computational Physics). The package stellaR (Dell’Omodarme and Valle, 2012) is an effort to make available to the astro physical community a basic tool set with the following capabilities: retrieve the required calculations from CDS; plot the information in a suitable form; construct by interpolation tracks or isochrones of compositions different to the ones available in the database; construct isochrones for age not included in the database; extract relevant evolutionary points from tracks or isochrones.",

To gain speed, we make use of analytic inverses of the working correlation when possible and a trick to find quick numeric inverses when an analytic inverse is not available.

    "title": "Possible Directions for Improving Dependency Versioning in R",
    "description": "One of the most powerful features of R is its infrastructure for contributed code. The built-in package manager and complementary repositories provide a great system for development and exchange of code, and have played an important role in the growth of the platform towards the de-facto standard in statistical computing that it is today. However, the number of packages on CRAN and other repositories has increased beyond what might have been foreseen, and is revealing some limitations of the current design. One such problem is the general lack of dependency versioning in the infrastructure. This paper explores this problem in greater detail, and suggests approaches taken by other open source communities that might work for R as well. Three use cases are defined that exemplify the issue, and illustrate how improving this aspect of package management could increase reliability while supporting further growth of the R community.",

    "title": "influence.ME: Tools for Detecting Influential Data in Mixed Effects Models",
    "description": "influence.ME provides tools for detecting influential data in mixed effects models. The application of these models has become common practice, but the development of diagnostic tools has lagged behind. influence.ME calculates standardized measures of influential data for the point estimates of generalized mixed effects models, such as DFBETAS, Cook’s distance, as well as percentile change and a test for changing levels of significance. influence.ME calculates these measures of influence while accounting for the nesting structure of the data. The package and measures of influential data are introduced, a practical example is given, and strategies for dealing with influential data are suggested. The application of mixed effects regression models has become common practice in the field of social sciences. As used in the social sciences, mixed effects regression models take into account that observations on individual respondents are nested within higher-level groups such as schools, classrooms, states, and countries (Snijders and Bosker, 1999), and are often referred to as multilevel regression models. Despite these models’ increasing popularity, diagnostic tools to evaluate fitted models lag behind. We introduce influence.ME (Nieuwenhuis, Pelzer, and te Grotenhuis, 2012), an R-package that provides tools for detecting influential cases in mixed effects regression models estimated with lme4 (Bates and Maechler, 2010). It is commonly accepted that tests for influential data should be performed on regression models, especially when estimates are based on a relatively small number of cases. However, most existing procedures do not account for the nesting structure of the data. As a result, these existing procedures fail to detect that higher-level cases may be influential on estimates of variables measured at specifically that level. In this paper, we outline the basic rationale on detecting influential data, describe standardized measures of influence, provide a practical example of the analysis of students in 23 schools, and discuss strategies for dealing with influential cases. Testing for influential cases in mixed effects regression models is important, because influential data negatively influence the statistical fit and generalizability of the model. In social science applications of mixed models the testing for influential data is especially important, since these models are frequently based on large numbers of observations at the individual level while the number of higher level groups is relatively small. For instance, Van der Meer, te Grotenhuis, and Pelzer (2010) were unable to find any country-level comparative studies involving more than 54 countries. With such a relatively low number of countries, a single country can easily be overly influential on the parameter estimates of one or more of the country-level variables.",

    "description": "In the nineteen seventies, Jurečková and Jaeckel proposed rank estimation for linear models. Since that time, several authors have developed inference and diagnostic methods for these estimators. These rank-based estimators and their associated inference are highly efficient and are robust to outliers in response space. The methods include estimation of standard errors, tests of general linear hypotheses, confidence intervals, diagnostic procedures including studentized residuals, and measures of influential cases. We have developed an R package, Rfit, for computing of these robust procedures. In this paper we highlight the main features of the package. The package uses standard linear model syntax and includes many of the main inference and diagnostic functions.",

These are mixed graphs (containing three types of edges) that are important because they capture the modified independence structure after marginalisation over, and conditioning on, nodes of directed acyclic graphs. We provide functions to verify whether a mixed graph implies that A is independent of B given C for any disjoint sets of nodes and to generate maximal graphs inducing the same independence structure of non-maximal graphs. Finally, we provide functions to decide on the Markov equivalence of two graphs with the same node set but different types of edges.",

This article explains what is meant by a complex path and demonstrates the usefulness of complex paths in drawing non-trivial shapes, logos, customised data symbols, and maps. One of the design goals of the R graphics system is to allow fine control over the small details of plots. One way that the R graphics system does this is by providing access to low-level generic graphics facilities, such as the ability to draw basic shapes and the ability to control apparently esoteric, but still useful, features of those shapes, such as the line end style used for drawing lines. In R version 2.12.0, another low-level graphics facility was added to R: the ability to draw complex paths (not just polygons). This article describes this new facility and presents some examples that show how complex paths might be useful.",

    "title": "Analysing Seasonal Data",
    "description": "Many common diseases, such as the flu and cardiovascular disease, increase markedly in winter and dip in summer. These seasonal patterns have been part of life for millennia and were first noted in ancient Greece by both Hippocrates and Herodotus. Recent interest has focused on climate change, and the concern that seasons will become more extreme with harsher winter and summer weather. We describe a set of R functions designed to model seasonal patterns in disease. We illustrate some simple descriptive and graphical methods, a more complex method that is able to model non-stationary patterns, and the case-crossover to control for seasonal confounding. In this paper we illustrate some of the functions of the season package (Barnett et al., 2012), which contains a range of functions for analysing seasonal health data. We were motivated by the great interest in seasonality found in the health literature, and the relatively small number of seasonal tools in R (or other software packages). The existing seasonal tools in R are: • the baysea function of the timsac package and the decompose and stl functions of the stats package for decomposing a time series into a trend and season; • the dynlm function of the dynlm package and the ssm function of the sspir package for fitting dynamic linear models with optional seasonal components; • the arima function of the stats package and the Arima function of the forecast package for fitting seasonal components as part of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model; and • the bfast package for detecting breaks in a seasonal pattern. These tools are all useful, but most concern decomposing equally spaced time series data. Our package includes models that can be applied to seasonal patterns in unequally spaced data. Such data are common in observational studies when the timing of responses cannot be controlled (e.g. for a postal survey). In the health literature much of the analysis of seasonal data uses simple methods such as com paring rates of disease by month or using a cosinor regression model, which assumes a sinusoidal seasonal pattern. We have created functions for these simple, but often very effective analyses, as we describe below. More complex seasonal analyses examine non-stationary seasonal patterns that change over time. Changing seasonal patterns in health are currently of great interest as global warming is predicted to make seasonal changes in the weather more extreme. Hence there is a need for statistical tools that can estimate whether a seasonal pattern has become more extreme over time or whether its phase has changed. Ours is also the first R package that includes the case-crossover, a useful method for controlling for seasonality. This paper illustrates just some of the functions of the season package. We show some descriptive functions that give simple means or plots, and functions whose goal is inference based on generalised linear models. The package was written as a companion to a book on seasonal analysis by Barnett and Dobson (2010), which contains further details on the statistical methods and R code.",

To make comparisons with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct search routines available in ’optim’. The MARSS package allows data to contain missing values and allows a wide variety of model structures and constraints to be specified (such as fixed or shared parameters). In addition to model-fitting, the package provides bootstrap routines for simulating data and generating confidence intervals, and multiple options for calculating model selection criteria (such as AIC).",

    "title": "openair - Data Analysis Tools for the Air Quality Community",
    "description": "The openair package contains data analysis tools for the air quality community. This paper provides an overview of data importers, main functions, and selected utilities and workhorse functions within the package and the function output class, as of package version 0.4-14. It is intended as an explanation of the rationale for the package and a technical description for those wishing to work more interactively with the main functions or develop additional functions to support ‘higher level’ use of openair and R. Large volumes of air quality data are routinely collected for regulatory purposes, but few of those in local authorities and government bodies tasked with this responsibility have the time, expertise or funds to comprehensively analyse this potential resource (Chow and Watson, 2008). Furthermore, few of these institutions can routinely access the more powerful statistical methods typically required to make the most effective use of such data without a suite of often expensive and niche-application proprietary software products. This in turn places large cost and time burdens on both these institutions and others (e.g. academic or commercial) wishing to contribute to this work. In addition, such collaborative working practices can also become highly restricted and polarised if data analysis undertaken by one partner cannot be validated or replicated by another because they lack access to the same licensed products. Being freely distributed under general licence, R has the obvious potential to act as a common platform for those routinely collecting and archiving data and the wider air quality community. This potential has already been proven in several other research areas, and commonly cited ex amples include the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al, 2004) and the Epitools collaboration (http://www.medepi.com/epitools). However, what is perhaps most inspiring is the degree of trans parency that has been demonstrated by the recent public analysis of climate change data in R and as sociated open debate (http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/category/r-climate-data-analysis tool/). Anyone affected by a policy decision, could potentially have unlimited access to scrutinise both the tools and data used to shape that decision.",

    "title": "Who Did What? The Roles of R Package Authors and How to Refer to Them",
    "description": "Computational infrastructure for representing persons and citations has been available in R for several years, but has been restructured through enhanced classes \"person\" and \"bibentry\" in recent versions of R. The new features include support for the specification of the roles of package authors (e.g. maintainer, author, contributor, translator, etc.) and more flexible formatting/printing tools among various other improvements. Here, we introduce the new classes and their methods and indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages. Specifically, we show how the authors of R packages can be specified along with their roles in package ‘DESCRIPTION’ and/or ‘CITATION’ files and the citations produced from it. R packages are the result of scholarly activity and as such constitute scholarly resources which must be clearly identifiable for the respective scientific communities and, more generally, today’s information society. In particular, packages published by standard repositories can be regarded as reliable sources which can and should be referenced (i.e. cited) by scientific works such as articles or other packages. This requires conceptual frameworks and computational infrastructure for describing bibliographic resources, general enough to encompass the needs of communities with an interest in R. These needs include support for exporting bibliographic metadata in standardized formats such as BIBTEX (Berry and Patashnik, 2010), but also facilitating bibliometric analyses and investigations of the social fabric underlying the creation of scholarly knowledge. The latter requires a richer vocabulary than commonly employed by reference management software such as BIBTEX, identifying persons and their roles in relation to bibliographic resources. For example, a thesis typically has an author and advisors. Software can have an (original) author and a translator to another language (such as from S to R). The maintainer of an R package is not necessarily an author. In this paper, we introduce the base R infrastructure (as completely available in R since version 2.14.0) for representing and manipulating such scholarly data: objects of class \"person\" (hereafter, per son objects) hold information about persons, possibly including their roles; objects of class \"bibentry\" (hereafter, bibentry objects) hold bibliographic information in enhanced BIBTEX style, ideally using person objects when referring to persons (such as authors or editors). Furthermore, we indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages, in particular in their ‘CITATION’ and ‘DESCRIPTION’ files.",

Starting with simple interactive use of rpart in Excel, we eventually package the code into an Excel-based application, hiding all details (including R itself) from the end user. In the end, our application implements a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with a clean separation of presentation and computation layer.",

    "description": "The R function glm uses step-halving to deal with certain types of convergence problems when using iteratively reweighted least squares to fit a generalized linear model. This works well in some circumstances but non-convergence remains a possibility, particularly with a non-standard link function. In some cases this is because step-halving is never invoked, despite a lack of convergence. In other cases step-halving is invoked but is unable to induce convergence. One remedy is to impose a stricter form of step-halving than is currently available in glm, so that the deviance is forced to decrease in every iteration. This has been implemented in the glm2 function available in the glm2 package. Aside from a modified computational algorithm, glm2 operates in exactly the same way as glm and provides improved convergence properties. These improvements are illustrated here with an identity link Poisson model, but are also relevant in other contexts.",

Using the R mailing lists, R-help and R-devel, we show how this combination can be used to describe people’s interests and to find out if authors who have similar interests actually communicate. We find that the expected positive relationship between sharing interests and communicating gets stronger as the centrality scores of authors in the communication networks increase.",

BMA forecasting models use mixture distributions, in which each component corresponds to an ensemble member, and the form of the component distribution depends on the weather parameter (temperature, quantitative precipitation or wind speed). The model parameters are estimated from training data. The GOP technique uses geostatistical methods to produce probabilistic forecasts of entire weather fields for temperature or pressure, based on a single numerical forecast on a spatial grid. Both packages include functions for evaluating predictive performance, in addition to model fitting and forecasting.",

We present functions to estimate an overall prevalence for a homogeneous population. Also, for this setting, we have functions to aid in the very important choice of the group size. When individuals come from a heterogeneous population, our group testing regression functions can be used to estimate an individual probability of disease positivity by using the group observations only. We illustrate our functions with data from a multiple vector transfer design experiment and a human infectious disease prevalence study.",

The generation of record pairs and comparison patterns from single data items are provided as well. Comparison patterns can be chosen to be binary or based on some string metrics.

    "title": "Two-sided Exact Tests and Matching Confidence Intervals for Discrete Data",
    "description": "There is an inherent relationship between two-sided hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. A series of two-sided hypothesis tests may be inverted to obtain the matching 100(1-α)% confidence interval defined as the smallest interval that contains all point null parameter values that would not be rejected at the α level. Unfortunately, for discrete data there are several different ways of defining two-sided exact tests and the most commonly used two-sided exact tests are defined one way, while the most commonly used exact confidence intervals are inversions of tests defined another way. This can lead to inconsistencies where the exact test rejects but the exact confidence interval contains the null parameter value. The packages exactci and exact2x2 provide several exact tests with the matching confidence intervals avoiding these inconsistencies as much as possible. Examples are given for binomial and Poisson parameters and both paired and unpaired 2 × 2 tables. Applied statisticians are increasingly being encouraged to report confidence intervals (CI) and parameter estimates along with p-values from hypothesis tests. The htest class of the stats package is ideally suited to these kinds of analyses, because all the related statistics may be presented when the results are printed. For exact two-sided tests applied to discrete data, a test-CI inconsistency may occur: the p-value may indicate a significant result at level α while the associated 100(1-α)% confidence interval may cover the null value of the parameter. Ideally, we would like to present a unified report (Hirji, 2006), whereby the p-value and the confidence interval match as much as possible.",

As such, it provides a very powerful way to do a literature search for functions and packages relevant to a particular topic of interest and could become virtually mandatory for authors of new packages or papers in publications such as The R Journal and the Journal of Statistical Software.",

However, the technical documentation accompanying most data sets used by researchers in these fields does not include syntax examples for analysts to make the transition from another statistical package to R. This paper describes the steps required to import health policy data into R, to prepare that data for analysis using the two most common complex survey variance calculation techniques, and to produce the principal set of statistical estimates sought by health policy researchers. Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component (MEPS-HC), this paper outlines complex survey data analysis techniques in R, with side-by-side comparisons to the SAS, Stata, and SUDAAN statistical software packages.",

Furthermore, the Hilbert spectral analysis of intrinsic mode functions provides frequency information evolving with time and quantifies the amount of variation due to oscillation at different time scales and time locations. In this article, we introduce an R package called EMD (Kim and Oh, 2008) that performs oneand twodimensional EMD and HS.",

Along with the flood of software sometimes comes an attitude that one need only learn, or teach, a sort of basic how-to-write-the-function level of R programming, beyond which most of the detail is unimportant or can be absorbed without much discussion. As delusions go, this one is not very objectionable if it encourages participation. Nevertheless, a delusion it is. In fact, functions are only one of a variety of important facets that R has acquired by intent or circumstance during the three-plus decades of the history of the software and of its predecessor S. To create valuable and trustworthy software using R often requires an understanding of some of these facets and their interrelations. This paper identifies six facets, discussing where they came from, how they support or conflict with each other, and what implications they have for the future of programming with R.",
