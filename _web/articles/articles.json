    "title": "Facets of R",
    "description": "We are seeing today a widespread, and welcome, tendency for non-computer-specialists among statisticians and others to write collections of R functions that organize and communicate their work. Along with the flood of software sometimes comes an attitude that one need only learn, or teach, a sort of basic how-to-write-the-function level of R programming, beyond which most of the detail is unimportant or can be absorbed without much discussion. As delusions go, this one is not very objectionable if it encourages participation. Nevertheless, a delusion it is. In fact, functions are only one of a variety of important facets that R has acquired by intent or circumstance during the three-plus decades of the history of the software and of its predecessor S. To create valuable and trustworthy software using R often requires an understanding of some of these facets and their interrelations. This paper identifies six facets, discussing where they came from, how they support or conflict with each other, and what implications they have for the future of programming with R.",

A key factor for the success of OSS over the last two decades is the Internet: Developers who rarely meet face-to-face can employ new means of communication, both for rapidly writing and deploying software (in the spirit of Linus Torvald’s “release early, release often paradigm”). Therefore, many tools emerged that assist a collaborative software development process, including in particular tools for source code management (SCM) and version control.",

(1998) invented EMD. The key feature of EMD is to decompose a signal into so-called intrinsic mode function (IMF). Furthermore, the Hilbert spectral analysis of intrinsic mode functions provides frequency information evolving with time and quantifies the amount of variation due to oscillation at different time scales and time locations. In this article, we introduce an R package called EMD (Kim and Oh, 2008) that performs oneand twodimensional EMD and HS.",

    "description": "IsoGene is an R package for the analysis of dose-response microarray experiments to identify gene or subsets of genes with a monotone relationship between the gene expression and the doses. Several testing procedures (i.e., the likelihood ratio test, Williams, Marcus, the M, and Modified M), that take into account the order restriction of the means with respect to the increasing doses are implemented in the package. The inference is based on resampling methods, both permutations and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM).",

The backpropagation algorithm and three versions of resilient backpropagation are implemented and it provides a custom-choice of activation and error function. An arbitrary number of covariates and response variables as well as of hidden layers can theoretically be included.

    "title": "Two-sided Exact Tests and Matching Confidence Intervals for Discrete Data",
    "description": "There is an inherent relationship between two-sided hypothesis tests and confidence intervals. A series of two-sided hypothesis tests may be inverted to obtain the matching 100(1-α)% confidence interval defined as the smallest interval that contains all point null parameter values that would not be rejected at the α level. Unfortunately, for discrete data there are several different ways of defining two-sided exact tests and the most commonly used two-sided exact tests are defined one way, while the most commonly used exact confidence intervals are inversions of tests defined another way. This can lead to inconsistencies where the exact test rejects but the exact confidence interval contains the null parameter value. The packages exactci and exact2x2 provide several exact tests with the matching confidence intervals avoiding these inconsistencies as much as possible. Examples are given for binomial and Poisson parameters and both paired and unpaired 2 × 2 tables. Applied statisticians are increasingly being encouraged to report confidence intervals (CI) and parameter estimates along with p-values from hypothesis tests. The htest class of the stats package is ideally suited to these kinds of analyses, because all the related statistics may be presented when the results are printed. For exact two-sided tests applied to discrete data, a test-CI inconsistency may occur: the p-value may indicate a significant result at level α while the associated 100(1-α)% confidence interval may cover the null value of the parameter. Ideally, we would like to present a unified report (Hirji, 2006), whereby the p-value and the confidence interval match as much as possible.",

We present functions to estimate an overall prevalence for a homogeneous population. Also, for this setting, we have functions to aid in the very important choice of the group size.

    "description": "Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides tools to examine relationships between people. Text Mining (TM) allows capturing the text they produce in Web 2.0 applications, for example, however it neglects their social structure. This paper applies an approach to combine the two methods named “content-based SNA”. Using the R mailing lists, R-help and R-devel, we show how this combination can be used to describe people’s interests and to find out if authors who have similar interests actually communicate. We find that the expected positive relationship between sharing interests and communicating gets stronger as the centrality scores of authors in the communication networks increase.",

The initial concentration is on data referenced by country or grid due to the frequency of use of such data in global assessments. Tools to link data referenced by country (either name or code) to a map, and then to display the map are provided as are functions to map global gridded data. Country and gridded functions accept the same arguments to specify the nature of categories and colour and how legends are formatted. This package builds on the functionality of existing packages, particularly sp, maptools and fields. Example code is provided to produce maps, to link with the packages classInt, RColorBrewer and ncdf, and to plot examples of publicly available country and gridded data.",

BMA forecasting models use mixture distributions, in which each component corresponds to an ensemble member, and the form of the component distribution depends on the weather parameter (temperature, quantitative precipitation or wind speed). The model parameters are estimated from training data. The GOP technique uses geostatistical methods to produce probabilistic forecasts of entire weather fields for temperature or pressure, based on a single numerical forecast on a spatial grid. Both packages include functions for evaluating predictive performance, in addition to model fitting and forecasting.",

    "description": "The R function glm uses step-halving to deal with certain types of convergence problems when using iteratively reweighted least squares to fit a generalized linear model. This works well in some circumstances but non-convergence remains a possibility, particularly with a non-standard link function. In some cases this is because step-halving is never invoked, despite a lack of convergence. In other cases step-halving is invoked but is unable to induce convergence. One remedy is to impose a stricter form of step-halving than is currently available in glm, so that the deviance is forced to decrease in every iteration. This has been implemented in the glm2 function available in the glm2 package. Aside from a modified computational algorithm, glm2 operates in exactly the same way as glm and provides improved convergence properties. These improvements are illustrated here with an identity link Poisson model, but are also relevant in other contexts.",

    "title": "Analysing Seasonal Data",
    "description": "Many common diseases, such as the flu and cardiovascular disease, increase markedly in winter and dip in summer. These seasonal patterns have been part of life for millennia and were first noted in ancient Greece by both Hippocrates and Herodotus. Recent interest has focused on climate change, and the concern that seasons will become more extreme with harsher winter and summer weather. We describe a set of R functions designed to model seasonal patterns in disease. We illustrate some simple descriptive and graphical methods, a more complex method that is able to model non-stationary patterns, and the case-crossover to control for seasonal confounding. In this paper we illustrate some of the functions of the season package (Barnett et al., 2012), which contains a range of functions for analysing seasonal health data. We were motivated by the great interest in seasonality found in the health literature, and the relatively small number of seasonal tools in R (or other software packages). The existing seasonal tools in R are: • the baysea function of the timsac package and the decompose and stl functions of the stats package for decomposing a time series into a trend and season; • the dynlm function of the dynlm package and the ssm function of the sspir package for fitting dynamic linear models with optional seasonal components; • the arima function of the stats package and the Arima function of the forecast package for fitting seasonal components as part of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model; and • the bfast package for detecting breaks in a seasonal pattern. These tools are all useful, but most concern decomposing equally spaced time series data. Our package includes models that can be applied to seasonal patterns in unequally spaced data. Such data are common in observational studies when the timing of responses cannot be controlled (e.g. for a postal survey). In the health literature much of the analysis of seasonal data uses simple methods such as com paring rates of disease by month or using a cosinor regression model, which assumes a sinusoidal seasonal pattern. We have created functions for these simple, but often very effective analyses, as we describe below. More complex seasonal analyses examine non-stationary seasonal patterns that change over time. Changing seasonal patterns in health are currently of great interest as global warming is predicted to make seasonal changes in the weather more extreme. Hence there is a need for statistical tools that can estimate whether a seasonal pattern has become more extreme over time or whether its phase has changed. Ours is also the first R package that includes the case-crossover, a useful method for controlling for seasonality. This paper illustrates just some of the functions of the season package. We show some descriptive functions that give simple means or plots, and functions whose goal is inference based on generalised linear models. The package was written as a companion to a book on seasonal analysis by Barnett and Dobson (2010), which contains further details on the statistical methods and R code.",

To make comparisons with other packages available, parameter estimation is also permitted via direct search routines available in ’optim’. The MARSS package allows data to contain missing values and allows a wide variety of model structures and constraints to be specified (such as fixed or shared parameters).

    "title": "openair - Data Analysis Tools for the Air Quality Community",
    "description": "The openair package contains data analysis tools for the air quality community. This paper provides an overview of data importers, main functions, and selected utilities and workhorse functions within the package and the function output class, as of package version 0.4-14. It is intended as an explanation of the rationale for the package and a technical description for those wishing to work more interactively with the main functions or develop additional functions to support ‘higher level’ use of openair and R. Large volumes of air quality data are routinely collected for regulatory purposes, but few of those in local authorities and government bodies tasked with this responsibility have the time, expertise or funds to comprehensively analyse this potential resource (Chow and Watson, 2008). Furthermore, few of these institutions can routinely access the more powerful statistical methods typically required to make the most effective use of such data without a suite of often expensive and niche-application proprietary software products. This in turn places large cost and time burdens on both these institutions and others (e.g. academic or commercial) wishing to contribute to this work. In addition, such collaborative working practices can also become highly restricted and polarised if data analysis undertaken by one partner cannot be validated or replicated by another because they lack access to the same licensed products. Being freely distributed under general licence, R has the obvious potential to act as a common platform for those routinely collecting and archiving data and the wider air quality community. This potential has already been proven in several other research areas, and commonly cited ex amples include the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al, 2004) and the Epitools collaboration (http://www.medepi.com/epitools). However, what is perhaps most inspiring is the degree of trans parency that has been demonstrated by the recent public analysis of climate change data in R and as sociated open debate (http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/category/r-climate-data-analysis tool/). Anyone affected by a policy decision, could potentially have unlimited access to scrutinise both the tools and data used to shape that decision.",

    "title": "Who Did What? The Roles of R Package Authors and How to Refer to Them",
    "description": "Computational infrastructure for representing persons and citations has been available in R for several years, but has been restructured through enhanced classes \"person\" and \"bibentry\" in recent versions of R. The new features include support for the specification of the roles of package authors (e.g. maintainer, author, contributor, translator, etc.) and more flexible formatting/printing tools among various other improvements. Here, we introduce the new classes and their methods and indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages. Specifically, we show how the authors of R packages can be specified along with their roles in package ‘DESCRIPTION’ and/or ‘CITATION’ files and the citations produced from it. R packages are the result of scholarly activity and as such constitute scholarly resources which must be clearly identifiable for the respective scientific communities and, more generally, today’s information society. In particular, packages published by standard repositories can be regarded as reliable sources which can and should be referenced (i.e. cited) by scientific works such as articles or other packages. This requires conceptual frameworks and computational infrastructure for describing bibliographic resources, general enough to encompass the needs of communities with an interest in R. These needs include support for exporting bibliographic metadata in standardized formats such as BIBTEX (Berry and Patashnik, 2010), but also facilitating bibliometric analyses and investigations of the social fabric underlying the creation of scholarly knowledge. The latter requires a richer vocabulary than commonly employed by reference management software such as BIBTEX, identifying persons and their roles in relation to bibliographic resources. For example, a thesis typically has an author and advisors. Software can have an (original) author and a translator to another language (such as from S to R). The maintainer of an R package is not necessarily an author. In this paper, we introduce the base R infrastructure (as completely available in R since version 2.14.0) for representing and manipulating such scholarly data: objects of class \"person\" (hereafter, per son objects) hold information about persons, possibly including their roles; objects of class \"bibentry\" (hereafter, bibentry objects) hold bibliographic information in enhanced BIBTEX style, ideally using person objects when referring to persons (such as authors or editors). Furthermore, we indicate how this functionality is employed in the management of R packages, in particular in their ‘CITATION’ and ‘DESCRIPTION’ files.",

    "title": "influence.ME: Tools for Detecting Influential Data in Mixed Effects Models",
    "description": "influence.ME provides tools for detecting influential data in mixed effects models. The application of these models has become common practice, but the development of diagnostic tools has lagged behind. influence.ME calculates standardized measures of influential data for the point estimates of generalized mixed effects models, such as DFBETAS, Cook’s distance, as well as percentile change and a test for changing levels of significance. influence.ME calculates these measures of influence while accounting for the nesting structure of the data. The package and measures of influential data are introduced, a practical example is given, and strategies for dealing with influential data are suggested. The application of mixed effects regression models has become common practice in the field of social sciences. As used in the social sciences, mixed effects regression models take into account that observations on individual respondents are nested within higher-level groups such as schools, classrooms, states, and countries (Snijders and Bosker, 1999), and are often referred to as multilevel regression models. Despite these models’ increasing popularity, diagnostic tools to evaluate fitted models lag behind. We introduce influence.ME (Nieuwenhuis, Pelzer, and te Grotenhuis, 2012), an R-package that provides tools for detecting influential cases in mixed effects regression models estimated with lme4 (Bates and Maechler, 2010). It is commonly accepted that tests for influential data should be performed on regression models, especially when estimates are based on a relatively small number of cases. However, most existing procedures do not account for the nesting structure of the data. As a result, these existing procedures fail to detect that higher-level cases may be influential on estimates of variables measured at specifically that level. In this paper, we outline the basic rationale on detecting influential data, describe standardized measures of influence, provide a practical example of the analysis of students in 23 schools, and discuss strategies for dealing with influential cases. Testing for influential cases in mixed effects regression models is important, because influential data negatively influence the statistical fit and generalizability of the model. In social science applications of mixed models the testing for influential data is especially important, since these models are frequently based on large numbers of observations at the individual level while the number of higher level groups is relatively small. For instance, Van der Meer, te Grotenhuis, and Pelzer (2010) were unable to find any country-level comparative studies involving more than 54 countries.

Since that time, several authors have developed inference and diagnostic methods for these estimators. These rank-based estimators and their associated inference are highly efficient and are robust to outliers in response space. The methods include estimation of standard errors, tests of general linear hypotheses, confidence intervals, diagnostic procedures including studentized residuals, and measures of influential cases. We have developed an R package, Rfit, for computing of these robust procedures. In this paper we highlight the main features of the package. The package uses standard linear model syntax and includes many of the main inference and diagnostic functions.",

These are mixed graphs (containing three types of edges) that are important because they capture the modified independence structure after marginalisation over, and conditioning on, nodes of directed acyclic graphs. We provide functions to verify whether a mixed graph implies that A is independent of B given C for any disjoint sets of nodes and to generate maximal graphs inducing the same independence structure of non-maximal graphs. Finally, we provide functions to decide on the Markov equivalence of two graphs with the same node set but different types of edges.",

    "title": "S, R, and Data Science",
    "description": "Data science is increasingly important and challenging. It requires computational tools and programming environments that handle big data and difficult computations, while supporting creative, high-quality analysis. The R language and related software play a major role in computing for data science. R is featured in most programs for training in the field. R packages provide tools for a wide range of purposes and users. The description of a new technique, particularly from research in statistics, is frequently accompanied by an R package, greatly increasing the usefulness of the description. The history of R makes clear its connection to data science. R was consciously designed to replicate in open-source software the contents of the S software. S in turn was written by data analysis researchers at Bell Labs as part of the computing environment for research in data analysis and collaborations to apply that research, rather than as a separate project to create a programming language. The features of S and the design decisions made for it need to be understood in this broader context of supporting effective data analysis (which would now be called data science). These characteristics were all transferred to R and remain central to its effectiveness. Thus, R can be viewed as based historically on a domain-specific language for the domain of data science. Note to R Journal readers: The following paper was published online in the History of Programming Languages (HOPL), Volume 4, in June 2020 (DOI 10.1145/3386334). The content seems likely to be of interest to many R Journal readers, and since HOPL is plausibly not typical reading for data scientists, the editors of the R Journal have kindly offered to republish the paper here.

    "contents": "\nGenesis: How did we get here?\nThe article “Software Engineering and R Programming: A Call to\nAction” summarizes the dichotomy between analytics and software\nengineering in the R ecosystem, provides examples where this leads to\nproblems and proposes what we as R users can do to bridge the gap.\nData Analytic Language\nThe fundamental basis of the dichotomy is inherent in the evolution\nof S and R: they are not programming languages, but they ended up being\nmistaken for such. S was designed to be a data analytic\nlanguage: to turn ideas into software quickly and faithfully, often used\nin “non-programming” style (Chambers 1998). Its original goal was to\nenable the statisticians to apply code which was written in programming\nlanguages (at the time mostly FORTRAN) to analyze data quickly and\ninteractively - for some suitable definition of “interactive” at the\ntime (Becker 1994). The success of S and then\nR can be traced to the ability to perform data analysis by applying\nexisting tools to data in creative ways. A data analysis is a quest - at\nevery step we learn more about the data which informs our decision about\nnext steps. Whether it is an exploratory data analysis leveraging\ngraphics or computing statistics or fitting models - the final goal is\ntypically not known ahead of time, it is obtained by an iterative\nprocess of applying tools that we as analysts think may lead us further\n(Tukey 1977). It is important to note\nthat this is exactly the opposite of software engineering where there is\na well-defined goal: a specification or desired outcome, which simply\nneeds to be expressed in a way understandable to the computer.\nFreedom for All\nThe second important design aspect rooted in the creativity required\nis the freedom the language provides. Given that the language can be\ncomputed upon means that a given expression may have different meaning\ndepending on how the called function decides to treat it and such\ndeviations are not entirely uncommon, typically referred to as\nnon-standard evaluation. Probably the best example is the sub-language\ndefined by the data.table\npackage (Dowle and Srinivasan\n2021) featuring the := operator which is parsed,\nbut not even used by the R language.\nAnalogously, there is no specific, prescribed object system, but\nrather one is free to implement any idea desirable, as witnessed by the\nfact that there are more than a handful of object system definitions\navailable in R and contributed packages. This freedom is what makes R\ngreat for experimentation with new ideas or concepts, but very hard to\ntreat as a programming language.\nWe have a language that is built on the idea of applying tools and\nwhich allows freedom to express new ideas so the last important step is\nhow to define new tools. R add-on packages (R Core\nTeam 2021) are the vehicle by which new tools can be defined\nand distributed to R users. Note that true to design goals, packages are\nnot limited to R code but rather can also include code written in\nprogramming languages such as C, C++ or Fortran. That in turn makes it\npossible to write packages that expand the scope of tools to other\nlanguages such as Java with RJava (Urbanek 2021) or Python with reticulate\n(Ushey et al.\n2022) simply by creating an R package which defines the\ninterface.\nSharing Packages\nBut this is also where we are entering the realm of software\nengineering. Now we are in the business of defining the tools\nas opposed to just using the tools. It also means that the\ntools have to worry about programming interfaces, defining behavior and\nall those pesky things we as statisticians don’t want to worry about.\nAlthough we originally started as R users, the moment we want\nto share any re-usable piece of code with others we are becoming\ndevelopers. Since no developer would mistake R for a\nprogramming language, it is analysts with background in various fields\nwhich use statistics one way or another that are more likely to\nuse R. However, as we become more comfortable with R, we start\nusing it as a programming language, not just analytic language, often\nbecause it is simply more convenient than having to learn a programming\nlanguage. This explains the empirical evidence (Pinto et\nal. 2018) of R package authors not being trained software\nengineers, but often scientists from other fields and any consequences\nthereof.\nHowever, as R packages started to emerge, it became clear that a\nloosely coupled structure is not enough and have to introduce software\nengineering concepts such as documentation and testing. R includes tools\nfor automated checking for packages to be able to provide at least some\nbasic guarantees. Packages provide examples which are supposed to be\nillustrative, but soon were used to perform limited testing. R itself is\nusing the same package structure and it was clear early that a test\nsuite is important and so was introduced. Consequently, the same\nfacilities were available to packages, but only very few were using it.\nThere are, however, no built-in tools for creating test suites. In core\nR those are hand-curated by experienced developers, but that does not\nscale to package space.\nOver 18,000 packages are now present in the Comprehensive R Archive\nNetwork (CRAN), a repository which has arguably played major role in the\nsuccess of R (Hornik and Leisch\n2002). This is not only a valuable resource for users, but\ntoday this rich collection of contributed R code in being used as an\nautomated test-suite for R. This is no coincidence, the importance of\nsoftware engineering concepts has been identified by the CRAN team long\ntime ago and the tools in R have been enhanced for that purpose (Hornik 2016). CRAN has been an\ninvaluable asset for the development of R based on examples and limited\ntests alone. It allows us the R Core Team to test changes in R against\ncode that was written by ingenious people that do not necessarily follow\ndocumentation, but instead write code that seems to work - possibly in\nways not intended in the first place. Consequently, improving the\nquality and coverage of tests in packages has not only positive impact\non the individual package, but on the quality of the entire CRAN\necosystem and R itself.\nCRAN performs reverse-dependency checks where packages are not\nallowed to break dependent package which is an important software\nengineering concept. One can see CRAN as performing continuous\nintegration and continuous testing if we consider all submitted packages\nas one big project. This is not universally liked among package authors,\nthough. Some find it too tedious to be responsible for software in the\nway a software engineer would be - a concern which is also highlighted\nby the article.\nSteal and Borrow\nOne perhaps surprising finding of the article was the analysis of\ncode fragment re-use (Claes et al. 2015). A\nquite recent example how dangerous such practice is was a piece of badly\nwritten JavaScript code from Stack Overflow (StackOverflow) which was copied so often\nthat it made it into the popular Unity game engine, effectively forcing\nbrowsers to lie about macOS versions (Chromium Bugs) just to not break\nmillions of released products. R code fragments are less likely to have\nsuch world-wide impact, but can be equally frustrating. The historically\nrelatively high cost of loading other packages was an incentive to\nsimply copy fragments instead, but the performance impact has been\ndiminishing with advancements in the R implementation. Still, I believe\nthe exact reasons for fragment re-use deserve further examination and\nmay reveal other, more benign motives.\nEvery Project Needs a\nConductor\nAnother good example of introducing software engineering principles\ninto the R world successfully is the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al. 2004). The authors\nrealized early that the project is too big for it to allow organic\ngrowth and have strongly encouraged the use of the S4 class system to\nbuild a class hierarchy specific to the tasks common to the Bioconductor\npackages. This enabled optimizations of implementation as a core part of\nthe system as opposed to individual approaches in each package.\nBioconductor was also encouraging unit tests and has maintained a build\nand reporting system similar to that of CRAN, in the early days even\npioneering functionality that was later added to core R.\nThe Gospel of Data Science\nI believe the Call to Action is a very timely contribution. Many R\nusers start as statisticians or data analysts in some domain since that\nis the main strength of R. Consequently, a lot of R code is never\npublicly visible. Code written for data analyses is not software\ndevelopment and is not published as software. So any global statistics\nabout R code have to be taken with that in mind. When considering R\npackages we are talking only about a fraction of the code written in R.\nHowever, building new tools is an important part of the R ecosystem and\nit has to be made clear that it is different from data analysis and thus\nrequires different skills and tools.\nThe main realization here is that at some point an R user may become\nan R developer, crossing the line from analysis into software\nengineering. And we are often unprepared for that, in part because of\nour diverse background. When I asked my junior colleagues at the Labs\nwhat they find most challenging yet valuable, the top item was learning\nsoftware engineering skills on the job. We were lucky to have both the\nauthors of S as well as the authors of Unix on the same floor, so we\nwere able to bridge the gap, but generally our schools don’t prepare for\nthat. That’s why I believe we must teach statistical computing together\nwith software engineering skills such as re-usability and testing\nconcepts. The current popularity of data science which bridges both\nworlds is a good excuse to make it actually happen in practice.\n\nCRAN packages used\ndata.table, RJava, reticulate\nCRAN\nTask Views implied by cited packages\nFinance, HighPerformanceComputing,\nModelDeployment,\nNumericalMathematics,\nTimeSeries\n\n\nR.

The future package implements the Future API for programming with futures in R. This minimal API provides sufficient constructs for implementing parallel versions of well-established, high-level map-reduce APIs. The future ecosystem supports exception handling, output and condition relaying, parallel random number generation, and automatic identification of globals lowering the threshold to parallelize code. The Future API bridges parallel frontends with parallel backends, following the philosophy that end-users are the ones who choose the parallel backend while the developer focuses on what to parallelize. A variety of backends exist, and third-party contributions meeting the specifications, which ensure that the same code works on all backends, are automatically supported. The future framework solves several problems not addressed by other parallel frameworks in R.",

To this end, this work introduces bdpar, a new highly customizable pipeline-based framework\n (using the OOP paradigm provided by R6 package) able to execute multiple preprocessing tasks over\n heterogeneous data sources. Moreover, to increase the flexibility and performance, bdpar provides\n helpful features such as (i) the definition of a novel object-based pipe operator (%>|%), (ii) the ability to\n easily design and deploy new (and customized) input data parsers, tasks, and pipelines, (iii) only-once\n execution which avoids the execution of previously processed information (instances), guaranteeing\n that only new both input data and pipelines are executed, (iv) the capability to perform serial or\n parallel operations according to the user needs, (v) the inclusion of a debugging mechanism which\n allows users to check the status of each instance (and find possible errors) throughout the process.",

    "description": "During the building of a genome-scale metabolic model, there are several dead-end metabo lites and substrates which cannot be imported, produced, nor used by any reaction incorporated in the network. The presence of these dead-end metabolites can block out the net flux of the objective function when it is evaluated through Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and when it is not blocked, bias in the biological conclusions increase. In this aspect, the refinement to restore the connectivity of the network can be carried out manually or using computational algorithms. The g2f package was designed as a tool to find the gaps from dead-end metabolites and fill them from the stoichiometric reactions of a reference, filtering candidate reactions using a weighting function. Additionally, this algorithm allows downloading all the sets of gene-associated stoichiometric reactions for a specific organism from the KEGG database. Our package is compatible with both 4.0.0 and 3.6.0 R versions.",

The package also provides functions to obtain ROC-based optimal\n threshold values using several criteria, namely, the Youden index criterion and the criterion that\n sets a target value for the false positive fraction. For the Bayesian methods, we provide tools for\n assessing model fit via posterior predictive checks, while the model choice can be carried out via\n several information criteria. Numerical and graphical outputs are provided for all methods. This is\n the only package implementing Bayesian procedures for ROC curves.",

Approximate moment estimators of the parameters of the distribution, to be used as starting values for numerical opti mization procedures, are discussed. “Exact” moment estimation, effected via a numerical procedure, and maximum likelihood estimation, are considered. The quality of the results produced by these estimators is assessed via simulation experiments. Several examples are given of fitting instances of the new distribution to real and simulated data. It is noted that the new distribution is a member of the exponential family. Expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the log-likelihood of the new distribution are derived. The former facilitates the numerical maximization of the likelihood with optim(); the latter provides means of calculating or estimating the covariance matrix of of the parame ter estimates. A discrepancy between estimates of the covariance matrix obtained by inverting the Hessian and those obtained by Monte Carlo methods is discussed.",

In many applications, spatial clustering in unobserved risk\n factors across nearby units can also affect their survival rates and odds of becoming immune. To\n address these methodological challenges, this article introduces our BayesSPsurv R-package, which\n fits parametric Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure) models that can account for spatial\n autocorrelation in both subpopulations of the user’s time-to-event data. Spatial autocorrelation is\n modeled with spatially weighted frailties, which are estimated using a conditionally autoregressive\n prior. The user can also fit parametric cure models with or without nonspatial i.i.d. frailties, and\n each model can incorporate time-varying covariates. BayesSPsurv also includes various functions to\n conduct pre-estimation spatial autocorrelation tests, visualize results, and assess model performance,\n all of which are illustrated using data on post-civil war peace survival.",

    "description": "It is often useful to tap information from a running R script. Obvious use cases include\n monitoring the consumption of resources (time, memory) and logging. Perhaps less obvious cases\n include tracking changes in R objects or collecting the output of unit tests. In this paper, we demonstrate\n an approach that abstracts the collection and processing of such secondary information from the\n running R script. Our approach is based on a combination of three elements. The first element is\n to build a customized way to evaluate code. The second is labeled local masking and it involves\n temporarily masking a user-facing function so an alternative version of it is called. The third element\n we label local side effect. This refers to the fact that the masking function exports information to the\n secondary information flow without altering a global state. The result is a method for building systems\n in pure R that lets users create and control secondary flows of information with minimal impact on\n their workflow and no global side effects.",

However, this test loses its power when the underlying distribution is not normal.

Adaptive modified maximum likelihood (AMML) estimators are used in developing the proposed tests since they are highly efficient under LTS distribution. An R package called RobustBF is given to show the implementation of these tests.

However, outstanding critiques of the statistical\n properties of propensity score matching have cast doubt on the statistical efficiency of this technique,\n and the poor scalability of optimal matching to large data sets makes this approach inconvenient\n if not infeasible for sample sizes that are increasingly commonplace in modern observational data.\n The stratamatch package provides implementation support and diagnostics for ‘stratified matching\n designs,’ an approach that addresses both of these issues with optimal propensity score matching for\n large-sample observational studies. First, stratifying the data enables more computationally efficient\n matching of large data sets. Second, stratamatch implements a ‘pilot design’ approach in order to\n stratify by a prognostic score, which may increase the precision of the effect estimate and increase\n power in sensitivity analyses of unmeasured confounding.",

Parameter estimates are obtained\n through a stochastic expectation-maximization algorithm. Standard errors are estimated using a\n non parametric bootstrap in the linear regression model and by a parametric bootstrap in the linear\n mixed regression model.

Some variables may be categorical, containing a\nhierarchy in the collection process, that may be measurements taken in\ndifferent geographic regions, or types of products sold by one company.\nExploring these multiple features can be daunting. Ensemble graphics\n(Unwin and\nValero-Mora 2018) bundle multiple views of a data set\ntogether into one composite figure. These provide an effective approach\nfor exploring and digesting many different aspects of temporal data.\nAdding interactivity to the ensemble can greatly enhance the exploration\nprocess.\nThis paper describes new software, the package, for exploring\ntemporal data using linked views and time wrapping. We first provide\nsome background to the approach based on setting up data structures and\nworkflow, and give an overview of interactive systems in R. The section\nfollowing introduces the package. We explain the mechanism for\nconstructing interactivity, to link between multiple hierarchical data\nobjects and hence plots, and describe the set up for interactively\nslicing and dicing time to wrap a series on itself to investigate\nperiodicities.\nBackground: tidy\ntemporal data and workflow\nThe package (Wang, Cook, and Hyndman\n2020) introduced a unified temporal data structure, referred\nto as a tsibble, to represent time series and longitudinal\ndata in a tidy format (Wickham 2014). A tsibble\nextends the data.frame and tibble classes with\nthe temporal contextual metadata: index and\nkey. The index declares a data column that\nholds time-related indices. The key identifies a collection\nof related series or panels observed over the index-defined\nperiod, which can comprise multiple columns. An example of a\ntsibble can be found in the monthly Australian retail trade\nturnover data (aus_retail), available in the package (O’Hara-Wild, Hyndman, and\nWang 2020c), shown below. The Month column holds\nyear-months as the index. State and\nIndustry are the identifiers for these 152 series, which\nform the key. Note that the column Series ID\ncould be an alternative option for setting up the key, but\nState and Industry are more readable and\ninformative. The index and key are “sticky”\ncolumns to a tsibble, forming critical pieces for fluent\ndownstream temporal data analysis.\n\n#> # A tsibble: 64,532 x 5 [1M]\n#> # Key:       State, Industry [152]\n#>   State                        Industry  `Series ID`    Month Turnover\n#>   <chr>                        <chr>     <chr>          <mth>    <dbl>\n#> 1 Australian Capital Territory Cafes, r… A3349849A   1982 Apr      4.4\n#> 2 Australian Capital Territory Cafes, r… A3349849A   1982 May      3.4\n#> 3 Australian Capital Territory Cafes, r… A3349849A   1982 Jun      3.6\n#> 4 Australian Capital Territory Cafes, r… A3349849A   1982 Jul      4  \n#> 5 Australian Capital Territory Cafes, r… A3349849A   1982 Aug      3.6\n#> # … with 64,527 more rows\n\nIn the spirit of tidy data from the (Wickham et al. 2019), the\ntidyverts suite features tsibble as the\nfoundational data structure, and helps to build a fluid and fluent\npipeline for time series analysis. Besides , the (O’Hara-Wild, Hyndman, and Wang 2020b)\nand (O’Hara-Wild, Hyndman, and Wang 2020a)\npackages fill the role of statistical analysis and forecasting in the\ntidyverts ecosystem. During all the steps of a time\nseries analysis, the series of interest, denoted by the key\nvariable, typically persist, through the trend modeling and also\nforecasting. We would typically want to examine the series across all of\nthe keys.\nFigure 1 illustrates examining temporal data\nwith many keys. The data has 152 series corresponding to different\nindustries in retail data. The multiple series are displayed using an\noverlaid time series plot, along with a scatterplot of two variables\n(trend versus seasonal strength) from feature space, where each series\nis represented by a dot. The feature space is computed using the\nfeatures() function from , which summarises the original\ndata for each series using various statistical features. This function\nalong with other tidyverts functions is\ntsibble-aware, and outputs a table in a reduced form where\neach row corresponds to a series, which can be graphically displayed as\nin Figure 1 (right).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Plots for the data, with the series of strongest\nseasonal strength highlighted. (a) An overlaid time series plot. (b) A\nscatter plot drawn from their time series features, where each dot\nrepresents a time series from (a).\n\n\n\nFigure 1 has also been highlighted to focus\non the one series with the strongest seasonality. To create this\nhighlighting, one needs to first filter the interesting series from the\nfeatures table, and join back to the original tsibble in\norder to examine its trend in relation to others. This procedure can\nsoon grow cumbersome if many series are to be explored. It illustrates a\nneed to query interesting series on the fly. Although these two plots\nare static, we can consider them as linked views because the common\nkey variables link between the two data tables producing\nthe two plots. This motivates the work in this package, described in\nthis paper, to enable interactivity of tsibble and\ntsibble-derived objects for rapid exploratory data\nanalysis.\nOverview of interactivity\nThere is a long history of interactive data visualization research\nand corresponding systems. Within R, the systems can be roughly divided\ninto systems utilizing web technology and those that do not.\nR (Chang et al. 2020) and (Vaidyanathan et al.\n2019) provide infrastructure connecting R with HTML elements\nand JavaScript that support the interactivity. The package makes it\npossible to embed JavaScript libraries into R so that users are able to\nwrite only R code to generate web-based plots. Many JavaScript charting\nlibraries have been ported to R as HTML widgets, including (Sievert 2020), (Hafen and Continuum Analytics, Inc.\n2020), and (J. Cheng, Karambelkar, and\nXie 2019) for maps. Interactions between different widgets\ncan be achieved with or (J. Cheng 2020). The extends with shared\nR6 instances to support linked brushing and filtering across widgets,\nwithout relying on .\nSystems without the web technology include , (Waddell\nand Oldford 2020), based on Tcl/Tk, and (Xie, Hofmann, and\nCheng 2014) based on Qt. They offer a wide array of\npre-defined interactions, such as selecting and zooming, to manipulate\nplots via mouse action, keyboard strokes, and menus. The package (X. Cheng, Cook, and\nHofmann 2016) is an add-on to , which provides specialized\ninteractions for temporal data, such as wrapping and mirroring.\nThe techniques implemented in the work described in this paper\nutilize web technology, including , , and R .\nUsing a\nshared temporal data object for interactivity\nThe package introduces a shared tsibble instance built on a\ntsibble. This allows for seamless communication between\ndifferent plots of temporal data. The as_shared_tsibble()\nfunction turns a tsibble into a shared instance,\nSharedTsibbleData, which is a subclass of\nSharedData from . This is an R6 object driving data\ntransmission across multiple views, due to its mutable and lightweight\nproperties. The package aims to streamline interactive exploration of\ntemporal data, with the focus of temporal elements and structured\nlinking.\nLinking between plots\nAs opposed to one-to-one linking, defaults to categorical variable\nlinking, where selecting one or more observations in one category will\nbroadcast to all other observations in this category. That is, linking\nis by key variables: within the time series plot, click on any data\npoint, and the whole line will be highlighted in response. The\nas_shared_tsibble() uses tsibble’s\nkey variables to achieve these types of linking.\nThe approach can also accommodate temporal data of nesting and\ncrossing structures. These time series are referred to as hierarchical\nand grouped time series in the literature (Hyndman and\nAthanasopoulos 2017). The aus_retail above is an\nexample of grouped time series. Each series in the data corresponds to\nall possible combinations of the State and\nIndustry variables, which means they are intrinsically\ncrossed with each other. When one key variable is nested within another,\nsuch as regional areas within a state, this is considered to be a\nhierarchical structure.\nThe spec argument in as_shared_tsibble()\nprovides a means to construct hybrid linking, that incorporates\nhierarchical and categorical linking. A symbolic formula can be passed\nto the spec argument, to define the crossing and/or nesting\nrelationships among the key variables. Adopting Wilkinson and Rogers (1973)’s\nnotation for factorial models, the spec follows the\n/ and * operator conventions to declare\nnesting and crossing variables, respectively. The spec for\nthe aus_retail data is therefore specified as\nState * Industry or Industry * State, which is\nthe default for the presence of multiple key variables. If\nthere is a hierarchy in the data, using / is required to\nindicate the parent-child relation, for a strictly one directional\nparent/child.\nTo illustrate nesting and crossing we use the\ntourism_monthly dataset (Tourism Research Australia 2020)\npackaged in . It contains monthly domestic overnight trips across\nAustralia. The key is comprised of three identifying\nvariables: State, Region, and\nPurpose (of the trip), in particular State\nnesting of Region, crossed together with\nPurpose. This specification can be translated as\nfollows:\n\n\nlibrary(tsibble)\nlibrary(tsibbletalk)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ntourism_shared <- tourism_monthly %>%\n  # Comment out the next line to run the full example\n  filter(State %in% c(\"Tasmania\", \"Western Australia\")) %>%\n  mutate(Region = stringr::str_replace(Region, \"Australia's \", \"WA's \")) %>%\n  as_shared_tsibble(spec = (State / Region) * Purpose)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a three-level hierarchy: the root node is implicitly\nAustralia, geographically disaggregated to states, and lower-level\ntourism regions. A new handy function plotly_key_tree() has\nbeen implemented to help explore the hierarchy. It interprets\nhierarchies in the shared tsibble’s spec as a tree view,\nbuilt with . The following code line produces the linked tree diagram\n(left panel of Figure 2). The visual for the tree\nhierarchy detangles a group of related series and provides a bird’s eye\nview of the data organization.\n\n\np_l <- plotly_key_tree(tourism_shared, height = 800, width = 800)\n\n\n\nThe tree plot provides the graphics skeleton, upon which the rest of\nthe data plots can be attached. In this example, small multiples of line\nplots are placed at the top right of Figure 2 to\nexplore the temporal trend across regions by the trip purpose. The\nshared tsibble data can be directly piped into code to create this.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\np_tr <- tourism_shared %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = Trips)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = Region), alpha = .5, size = .4) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Purpose, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_x_yearmonth(date_breaks = \"5 years\", date_labels = \"%Y\")\n\n\n\nThese line plots are heavily overplotted. To tease apart structure in\nthe multiple time series, the features() function computes\ninteresting characteristics, including the measures of trend and\nseasonality. These are displayed in the scatterplot at the bottom right,\nwhere one dot represents one series.\n\n\nlibrary(feasts)\ntourism_feat <- tourism_shared %>%\n  features(Trips, feat_stl)\np_br <- tourism_feat %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = trend_strength, y = seasonal_strength_year)) +\n  geom_point(aes(group = Region), alpha = .8, size = 2)\n\n\n\nThere is one final step, to compose the three plots into an ensemble\nof coordinated views for exploration, shown in Figure\n2.

2: Exploring an ensemble of linked plots of the\nAustralian tourism data, built on a object. Click one of the nodes in\nthe hierarchical tree to enable persistent linked brushing to compare\ntwo groups. Points and lines can also be selected in other plots. (Only\nWestern Australia and Tasmania are included for the interactive plot in\nthe html version, so size reasons.)\n\n\n\nSince all plots are created from one shared tsibble data source, they\nare self-linking views. Nodes, lines, and points are hoverable and\nclickable. Given the spec, clicking either one element in\nany plot highlights all points that match the Region\ncategory, that is, categorical linking. Figure 2\nprovides an interactive exploration. The steps in getting to this point\nwere:\nA branch of the tree corresponding to Western Australia was first\nselected. (The names of the regions are a little odd, which is a quirk\nof the data set, but all four areas, Australia’s South West, ….,\ncorrespond to tourist destinations in Western Australia. Hovering over\nthe node on the branch brings up the state name.) This generated the\nresponse in the line plots and the scatterplot that colored\ncorresponding time series and points as blue.\nTo enable persistent selection, in order to compare regions or\nstates, “Shift” and click on the tree was done, after switching the\ncolor to red. This generated the response that points and time series\ncorresponding to Sydney were highlighted in red.\nHovering over the points brings up the label for Sydney.\nDomestic tourism sees Sydney as one of the most popular destinations\nin the realm of business and friends visiting over the years. Despite\nthe relatively weaker performance in Western Australia, Australia’s\nNorth West region sees a strongest upward trend in business, bypassing\nSydney in some years.\nIn summary, shared tsibble data nicely bridges between the and\ntidyverts ecosystems for temporal data using the common\n“key”. The as_shared_tsibble() provides a symbolic user\ninterface for the effortless construction of a hybrid of hierarchical\nand categorical linking between plots. The\nplotly_key_tree() function, in turn, decodes the\nhierarchical specification to plot a tree for data overview and\nnavigation, when accompanied by more detailed plots.\nSlicing and dicing time\nAn important aspect of temporal data is the time context. Time has a\ncyclical structure, that may correspond to seasonal patterns to be\ndiscovered. The index component of the (shared) tsibble\ndata forms the basis for exploring seasonality. To investigate for\nperiodic or aperiodic patterns, series should be wrapped on themselves,\nwhere the index is broken into temporal components like quarter or day.\nWe shall explore this with pedestrian traffic in Melbourne,\nAustralia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Animations showing wrapping after slicing the data\nat different intervals, (a) none, (b) daily and (c) weekly. This type of\ninteraction is made possible with Shiny elements.\n\n\n\nThe city of Melbourne has sensors installed at various locations, to\nrecord hourly counts of pedestrians, in order to capture the daily\nrhythms of the downtown (City of Melbourne 2020).\nFigure 3 shows the first five months of 2020 foot\ntraffic at four different locations, for three different time slices,\ndaily, weekly and full five months. Plot 3 shows\nhourly counts from January to May on an absolute timeline, facetted by\nlocations. The stage 3 COVID-19 lockdown, on March 16, is marked by a\nchange of color. (The pre-lockdown period is colored with dark green and\nlockdown with orange.) We can see a significant decline in foot traffic\nat all four locations. QV Market is less affected probably because this\nis a major produce market, an essential service that continued to\noperate. Bourke St, a major shopping center, sees a gradual uptick in\nthe last weeks of the period indicating that people were getting back\ninto the shops.\nFigure 3 shows the slicing and wrapping of the\nseries into daily and weekly sections, respectively. Multiple\nseasonalities pop out. There tends to be a daily pattern, especially\nvisible at the main train station, Southern Cross Station. There is also\na weekday vs weekend pattern, also most visible at Southern Cross\nStation. These seasonal patterns are still present during the lockdown,\nbut the magnitude is greatly reduced. Numbers are also down at the\nproduce market and the shopping center. Birrarung Marr is the most\naffected. This is the location of special events, and it is clear that\nthese have completely disappeared during the lockdown.\nThe wrapping procedure involves slicing the time index into seasonal\nperiods of interest, and the result is diced time. For example, hourly\npedestrian data can be decomposed into 24-hour blocks, which then\noverlays the counts for all respective days, as done in plot\n3. For exploration, this slice position should be\ncontrolled interactively, so that many different slices can be examined\nrapidly. This can be achieved using shiny, with the functions provided\nin the .\nThis shiny module, decoupled to tsibbleWrapUI() and\ntsibbleWrapServer(), presents a clean interface and forms a\nreusable component that could be embedded in any shiny application. In\ngeneral, a shiny module provides a vehicle for modularising shiny\napplications, relevant for both users and developers. As with all shiny\nmodules, the first argument in both functions in requires a\nuser-supplied id string that must be unique. The UI function\ntsibbleWrapUI() simply shows a slider that animates or\ncontrols the number of periods to be diced. The workhorse is the server\nfunction tsibbleWrapServer(), encapsulating the algorithm\nthat transforms data and sends messages to update the plot accordingly.\nThe plot argument expects a ggplot or\nplotly object, where one can plot data using either lines\nor other graphical elements (such as boxplots). As the function name\nsuggests, a (shared) tsibble is needed to start the engine, so that the\ntime index can be retrieved for dissection. The\nperiod option semantically takes a desired number of\nseasonal periods to be shifted, for example data shifted by “1 day”, “2\ndays”, or “1 week”, etc. In other words, the period defines\nthe grind level. For date-times (represented by POSIXt),\nthe granularity ranges from fine “day” to a much coarser “year”. The\nfollowing code snippet generates Figure 3. The\ncreation of the pedestrian20 data is available in\nsupplementary R files.\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(shiny)\np_line <- pedestrian20 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Date_Time, y = Count, colour = Lockdown)) +\n  geom_line(size = .3) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Sensor, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(x = \"Date Time\") +\n  scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nui <- fluidPage(\n  tsibbleWrapUI(\"dice\")\n)\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  tsibbleWrapServer(\"dice\", ggplotly(p_line, height = 700), period = \"1 day\")\n}\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n\n\n\nFigure 3 corresponds to the initial state, with\nthe slider incremented by 1-day units. The “play” button near the end of\nthe slider can automatically animate the slicing and dicing process,\nwalking the viewer through all 24 hours of the 152 days. Alternatively,\nusers can drag the slider to examine selected slices.\nIn response to the slider input, the plot will be updated and loaded\nwith newly transformed data. At its core, keeping the application as\nperformant as possible is the top priority. Without completely redrawing\nthe plot, the plotlyProxy() react method is invoked\ninternally for talking to shiny. The underlying tsibble data is being\ncalled back and processed in R. Only transformed data gets fed back to\nthe shiny server, for updating with resetting the x-axis ranges and\nbreaks. The other plot configurations, such as marks, y-axes, and\nlayouts, are cached and used as is.\nThe new shiny module exploits the temporal aspect for a tsibble\nobject, available through the index attribute. It allows\nusers to slide through relative periods to digest seasonal behaviors,\nwith a nimble user experience.\nSummary\nAt the heart of the package is a blending of the best bits from , , ,\nand .\nThe as_shared_tsibble() turns a tsibble\nobject to a shared data class, with an option to express any nesting and\ncrossing structures from the key attribute. If nesting is\nfound in the data, the plotly_key_tree() creates an\ninteractive hierarchical tree to help with the data overview. This sets\nthe stage for hierarchical and categorical linking between multiple\nviews from one shared tsibble.\nA new shiny module, tsibbleWrapUI() and\ntsibbleWrapServer(), provides a lens for looking at\ntemporal aspects of a tsibble, in particular seasonal or\ncyclical variations. The slicing and dicing technique efficiently wrap\ntime lines for user-defined plots. The plotlyProxy() react\nmethod makes it possible to send wrapped data to the server and amend\nthe plot straight way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChang, Winston, Joe Cheng, JJ Allaire, Yihui Xie, and Jonathan\nMcPherson. 2020.

    "description": "The conveyance of clinical trial explorations and analysis results from a statistician to a clinical investigator is a critical component of the drug development and clinical research cycle. Automating the process of generating documents for data descriptions, summaries, exploration, and analysis allows the statistician to provide a more comprehensive view of the information captured by a clinical trial, and efficient generation of these documents allows the statistican to focus more on the conceptual development of a trial or trial analysis and less on the implementation of the summaries and results on which decisions are made. This paper explores the use of the listdown package for automating reproducible documents in clinical trials that facilitate the collaboration between statisticians and clinicians as well as defining an analysis pipeline for document generation.",

Graphs, tables, and other analysis artifacts are at the nexus of\nthese collaborations. They facilitate identifying problems and bugs in\nthe data preparation and processing stage, they help to build an\nintuitive understanding of mechanisms of disease and their treatment,\nthey elucidate prognostic and predictive relationships, they provide\ninsight that results in new hypotheses, and they convince researchers of\nanalyses testing hypotheses.\nDespite their importance, the process of generating these artifacts\nis usually done in an ad-hoc manner. This is partially because of the\nnuance and diversity of the hypotheses and scientific questions being\ninterrogated and, to a lesser degree, the variation in clinical data\nformatting. The usual process usually has a statistician providing a\nstandard set of artifacts, receiving feedback, and providing updates\nbased on feedback. Work performed for one trial is rarely leveraged on\nothers, and as a result, a large amount of work needs to be reproduced\nfor each trial.\nThere are two glaring problems with this approach. First, each\nanalysis of a trial requires a substantial amount of error-prone work.\nWhile the variation between trials means some work needs to be done for\npreparation, exploration, and analysis, many aspects of these trials\ncould be better automated resulting in greater efficiency and accuracy.\nSecond, because this work is challenging, it often occupies the majority\nof the statisticians’ effort. Less time is spent on trial design and\nanalysis, and then this portion is taken up by a clinician who often has\nless expertise with the statistical aspects of the trial. As a result,\nthe extra effort spent on processing data undermines statisticians’ role\nas a collaborator and relegates them to service provider. Need tools\nleveraging existing work to more efficiently provide holistic views on\ntrials will result in less effort and more accurate and comprehensive\ntrial design and analysis.\nThe richness of the R Core Team\n(2012) package\necosystem, particularly with its emphasis on analysis, visualization,\nreproducibility, and dissemination makes the goal of creating these\ntools for clinical trials feasible. Generation of tables is supported by\npackages including tableone (Yoshida and Bartel 2020), gt (Iannone et al. 2020), gtsummary (Sjoberg et al.\n2020). Visualization is achieved using package including ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) and survminer (Kassambara et al.\n2020). We can even provide interactive presentations of data\nwith DT (Xie et al. 2020), plotly (Sievert 2020), and trelliscopejs (Hafen and Schloerke 2020).\nIt should also be realized that work building on these tools for\nclinical trial data is already in process. The greport\n(Harrell Jr 2020) package provides\ngraphical summaries for clinical trials and has been used in conjunction\nwith rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2020) to produce specific\ntrial report types with a specified format.\nUsing\nlistdown for programmatic, collaborative clinical trial\ndocument generation\nThe listdown package (Kane\net al. 2020) was recently released to automate the process of\ngenerating reproducible (RMarkdown) documents. Objects derived from a\nsummary, exploration, or analysis are stored hierarchically in an R\nlist, which defines the structure of the document. These\nobjects are referred to as computational components since they\nare derived from computation, as opposed to prose, which makes up the\nnarrative components of a document.\nThe computational components capture and structure the objects to be\npresented. Describing how the objects will be presented and how the\ndocument will be rendered is handled through the creation of a\nlistdown object. The separation between how computational\ncomponents are created and how they are shown to a user provides two\nadvantages. First, it decouples the data processing and analysis from\nits exploration and visualization. For compute-intensive analyses, this\nseparation is critical for avoiding redundant computations for small\nchanges in the presentation. It also discourages putting\ncompute-intensive code into RMarkdown documents. Second, it provides the\nflexibility to quickly change how a computational component is\nvisualized or summarized or even how a document is rendered. This makes\ntransitioning from an interactive .html document to a static .pdf\ndocument significantly easier than substituting functions and parameters\nin an R Markdown document.\nThe package has been found to be particularly useful in the reporting\nand research of clinical trial data. In particular, the package has been\nused for server collaborations focusing on either the analysis of past\ntrial data to formulate a new trial or in trial monitoring where trial\ntelemetry (enrollment, responses, etc.) is reported, and initial\nanalyses are conveyed to a clinician. The associated presentations\nrequire very little context since clinicians often have as good an\nunderstanding of the data collected as that of the statistician’s\nmeaning narrative components are not needed. At the same time, a large\nnumber of hierarchical, heterogeneous artifacts (tables and multiple\ntypes of plots) can be automated where manual creation of RMarkdown\ndocuments would be inconvenient and inefficient.\nThe rest of this document describes concepts implemented in the listdown package for automated, reproducible document\ngeneration and shows its use with a simplified, synthetic clinical trial\ndata set whose variables are typical of a non-small cell lung cancer\ntrial. The data set comes from the forceps (Kane 2020) package. As of the time this\ndocument was written, the package is under development and is not\navailable on CRAN. However, it can be installed as follows.\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"kaneplusplus/forceps\")\n\n\n\nThe following section uses the trial data to construct a pipeline for\ndocument generation. We note that both the data and the pipeline are\nsimple when compared to most analyses of this type. However, it is\nsufficient to illustrate accompanying concepts, and both the analyses\nand concepts translate readily to real-world applications. A final\nsection discusses the use of the package and its current direction.\nConstructing a\npipeline for document generation\nThe process of analyzing data can be described using the classic\nwaterfall model of Benington (1983) where the output (the analysis\npresentation or service) is dependent on a sequence of tasks that come\nbefore it. This dependency structure means that if a problem is detected\nin a given stage of the production of the analysis, all downstream parts\nmust be rerun to reflect the change. A graphical depiction of the\nwaterfall model, specific to data analyses (clinical or otherwise) is\nshown in Figure \\(\\ref{fig:waterfall}\\). Note that data\nexploration and visualization are an integral part of all stages of the\nproduction and are often the means for identifying issues and refining\nanalyses.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The data analysis waterfall.\n\n\n\nAs explained in the previous section, we are going to implement a\nsimple analysis pipeline. The data acquisition and preprocessing steps\nare handled by importing data sets from the forceps\npackage and using some of the functions implemented in the package to\ncreate a single trial data set, thereby de-emphasizing these components\nin the pipeline. While these steps are critical, the emphasis of this\npaper is the incorporation of the listdown package into\nthe later stages.\nData acquisision and\npreprocessing\nData acquisition refers to the portion of the analysis pipeline where\nthe data is retrieved from some managed data store for integration into\nthe pipeline. These data sets may be retrieved as tables from a\ndatabase, case reports, Analysis Data Model (ADaM) data formatted\naccording to the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)\n(Clinical data interchange standards consortium\n2020), Electronic Health Records, or other clinical Real\nWorld Data (RWD) formats. These data are then transformed to a format\nappropriate for analysis.\nIn our simple example, this is accomplished by loading data\ncorresponding to trial outcomes, patient adverse events, patient\nbiomarkers, and patient demography and transforming them into a single\ndata set with one row per patient and one variable per column using the\nforceps and dplyr (Wickham et\nal. 2020) packages. The data also includes longitudinal\nadverse event information, which will is stored as a nested data frame\nin the ae_long column of the resulting data set.\n\n\nlibrary(forceps)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata(lc_adsl, lc_adverse_events, lc_biomarkers, lc_demography)\n\nlc_trial <- consolidate(\n  list(adsl = lc_adsl,\n       adverse_events = lc_adverse_events %>% \n         cohort(on = \"usubjid\", name = \"ae_long\"),\n       biomarkers = lc_biomarkers,\n       demography = lc_demography %>% \n         select(-chemo_stop)\n  ),\n  on = \"usubjid\")\n\nlc_trial\n\n\n# A tibble: 558 × 18\n   usubjid best_response       pfs_days pfs_censor os_days os_censor\n     <dbl> <chr>                  <dbl>      <dbl>   <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1    1003 Stable Disease           101          1     233         1\n 2    1005 Complete Response         78          0     184         1\n 3    1006 Progressive Disease      253          1     333         1\n 4    1009 Partial Response         130          0     643         0\n 5    1014 Complete Response         41          1     116         1\n 6    1018 Partial Response         194          1     423         1\n 7    1023 Stable Disease            49          1     337         1\n 8    1025 Stable Disease            95          1     589         1\n 9    1030 Complete Response        351          1     688         1\n10    1033 Complete Response         33          1     125         1\n# … with 548 more rows, and 12 more variables: chemo_stop <chr>,\n#   arm <chr>, ae_count <int>, ae_long <list>, egfr_mutation <chr>,\n#   smoking <chr>, ecog <chr>, prior_resp <chr>, site_id <int>,\n#   sex <chr>, refractory <lgl>, age <dbl>\n\nAnalysis\ndefining and structuring the computational components\nThe next step is to define the computational components as a\nhierarchical, named list of objects that will be presented. These\nobjects are generally derived from the exploratory, descriptive, and\nanalysis stages and are presented as visualizations and tables. This\nexample will focus on the exploratory and descriptive portions. We will\nstart by defining a new function class_and_tag(), which\ntakes an object and prepends a class designation to the objects along\nwith optionally associating the object with a set of attributes. This\nextra information will be used later in order to dispatch to the proper\nfunctions responsible for presenting the objects in a resulting R\nMarkdown document. If no such information is given, then the object will\nbe presented as it usually would in the document. It should also be\nnoted that class_and_tag() is provided for convenience here\nand will be available in subsequent package versions.\n\n\n\nThe next step is to define the computational components that will be\npresented. Our simple example will contain three sections: Outcome\nInformation, Adverse Events, Biomarkers. The Adverse Events and\nBiomarkers sections will each show summary tables of one of the\nvariables from those data. The Outcome Information section will be\ncomposed of two subsections, with the first (Best Response) providing a\nsummary of the best response by the arm and the second (Overall\nSurvival) showing a survival plot by arm of the overall survival. The\ncall to ld_cc_dendro() at the end of the example provides\nof dendrogram of the hierarchical structure.\n\n\nlibrary(listdown)\n\ntrial_summary <- list(\n  `Outcome Information` = list(\n    `Best Response` = lc_trial %>% \n      select(best_response, arm) %>% \n      class_and_tag(\"summary_table\", by = \"arm\"),\n    `Overall Survival` = lc_trial %>% \n      select(os_days, os_censor, arm) %>% \n      class_and_tag(\"survival_plot\", \n                    time = \"os_days\", \n                    censor = \"os_censor\", \n                    x = \"arm\")),\n  `Adverse Events` = lc_trial %>%\n    select(best_response) %>%\n    class_and_tag(\"summary_table\"),\n  `Biomarkers` = list(\n    `EGFR` = lc_trial %>%\n      select(egfr_mutation) %>%\n      class_and_tag(\"summary_table\")\n  )\n)\n\nld_cc_dendro(trial_summary)\n\n\n\ntrial_summary\n  |-- Outcome Information\n   |-- Best Response\n   |  o-- object of type(s):summary_table tbl_df tbl data.frame\n   o-- Overall Survival\n      o-- object of type(s):survival_plot tbl_df tbl data.frame\n  |-- Adverse Events\n  |  o-- object of type(s):summary_table tbl_df tbl data.frame\n  o-- Biomarkers\n   o-- EGFR\n      o-- object of type(s):summary_table tbl_df tbl data.frame\n\nCommunicating results\nThe objects have been constructed and they have been structured. The\nnext step is to define how they will be presented. This is done by\ncreating two functions make_summary and\nmake_survival_plot. The former takes a\ndata.frame and uses the gtsummary package\nto summarize the results. If the data.frame includes an\nattribute named by and denoting a valid variable in the\ndata set, then the summary is created conditionally on that variable.\nThe latter function also takes a data.frame and uses\nattributes to denote variables on which a Kaplan-Meier plot can be\nconstructed using the survival (Terry M. Therneau and Patricia M. Grambsch\n2000) and survminer packages. The functions\nare written to a file called decorators.r and will be used\nby the R Markdown document to render the final document.\n\n\nlibrary(gtsummary)\nlibrary(survival)\nlibrary(survminer)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmake_summary <- function(x) {\n  by <- attributes(x)$by\n  tbl_summary(x, by = by)\n}\n\nmake_survival_plot <- function(.x) {\n  att <- attributes(.x)\n  x <- ifelse(is.null(att$x), \"1\", att$x)\n  form <- sprintf(\"Surv(%s, %s) ~ %s\", att$time, att$censor, x) %>%\n    as.formula()\n  fit <- surv_fit(form, data = as.data.frame(.x))\n  ggsurvplot(fit, data = as.data.frame(.x))\n}\n\n\n\nThe next step is to connect the computational components to the\nfunctions that will present them using the listdown()\nfunction. First, the computational components are stored in the\ntrial_summary object are written to the disk. The resulting\nR Markdown document will read it in based on the\nload_cc_expr argument. Along with reading in the data,\ninitialization in the R Markdown document will include sourcing the\ndecorators.r file previously written to disk. This is\nhandled with the init_expr argument. The\ndecorators argument takes a list where the name specifies\nthe class and the list element corresponds to a function that will\npresent objects of the specified class. For example,\nsummary_table objects are sent to the\nmake_summary() function for presentation. This allows us to\nconnect objects to their appropriate function to process and present\nthem. Finally, echo and message chunk options\nare set to FALSE so that the code and associated messages\nwill not appear in the final rendered document. The last line of code\nbelow displays the first 12 lines of R Markdown code chunks as they will\nappear in the corresponding document.\n\n\nsaveRDS(trial_summary, \"cc.rds\")\n\nld <- listdown(load_cc_expr = readRDS(\"cc.rds\"),\n               init_expr = source(\"decorators.r\"),\n               decorator = list(summary_table = make_summary,\n                                survival_plot = make_survival_plot),\n               echo = FALSE,\n               message = FALSE)\n\nld_make_chunks(ld)[1:12]\n\n\n [1] \"\"                                    \n [2] \"```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}\"\n [3] \"source(\\\"decorators.r\\\")\"            \n [4] \"\"                                    \n [5] \"cc_list <- readRDS(\\\"cc.rds\\\")\"      \n [6] \"```\"                                 \n [7] \"\"                                    \n [8] \"# Outcome Information\"               \n [9] \"\"                                    \n[10] \"## Best Response\"                    \n[11] \"\"                                    \n[12] \"```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}\"\n\nThe last step creates the R Markdown header, writes it along with the\nR code chunks to a file named\n\"simple-data-trial-summary.rmd\" and knits the file with the\nknitr package (Xie\n2020) to a pdf document, per the output argument\nof the ld_rmarkdown_header() function.\nmd_header is a yml object making it easy to\ncontrol how the document is rendered. The code to generate the document\nalong with the resulting R Markdown and output file constitute a\nreproducible workflow that can be quickly iterated upon and adapted for\ndifferent types of explorations, summaries, and analyses.\n\n\nlibrary(knitr)\n\nmd_header <- ld_rmarkdown_header(\"Fake Data Trial Summary\",\n                                 output = \"pdf_document\")\n\nld_write_file(\n  rmd_header = as.character(md_header),\n  ld = ld_make_chunks(ld),\n  file_name = \"simple-data-trial-summary.rmd\")\n\nknit(\"simple-data-trial-summary.rmd\")\n\n\n\nDirection\nThe listdown package has been successfully used for\ncollaborations on several clinical trial analyses. The package works\nparticularly well when creating large, navigable sets of summaries and\nvisualizations. Current work focuses on two areas. First is the\nconstruction of standard decorators. By packaging decorators and\nassociated functionality, presentations can be made rich as they are\ndeveloped over time. This standardization also makes it easier to\nleverage work in configuring chunks so that they can be made more\naesthetic by default. In addition, we have been working on abstract and\nformalize the notion of document composition. In the example presented,\nthe aggregation of the header and R code chunks into a file was\nsufficient for generating a document. However, the composition of other\noutputs is also supported. For example, the top-level names of the trial\nsummary could just as easily designate tabs on a web page or other\ntarget. The notion of a composer would allow a user to target a greater\nvariety of output types, better suiting the application under\nconsideration and the target audience for the presentation.\n\nCRAN Task Views implied\nby cited packages\n\n\nJ.

While adjacent,\ndata-focused areas of biomedicine and health related research have\nrecently seen increased attention, especially the analysis of real-world\nevidence (RWE) and electronic health records (EHR) in particular,\nclinical trial data maintains several distinct quality advantages,\nenumerated here.\nFeatures and measurements are selected for their relevance. Unlike\nEHR’s or other similar data, variables collected for a clinical trial\nare included because they are potentially relevant to the disease under\nconsideration or the treatment whose efficacy is being analyzed. This\nmakes the variable selection process considerably easier than that where\ndata collection has not been designed for a targeted analysis of this\ntype.\nData collection procedures are carefully prescribed. Clinical trial\ndata is uniform in both which variables are collected and how they are\ncollected. This ensures data quality across trial sites ensuring that\nvariables are relatively complete as well as consistent.\nInclusion/Exclusion criteria define the population. Since RWE\nstudies are observational, the populations they consider are not always\nwell-understood due to bias in the collection process. On the other\nhand, clinical trial data sets are generally controlled and randomized,\nwith well-documented inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nAlong with maintaining higher quality clinical trial data is more\navailable and more easily accessible when compared to real-world data\nsources, which often require affiliations with appropriate research\ninstitutions as well as infrastructure and appropriate staff, including\ndata managers, to extract data. By contrast, modern clinical trial data\norganizations allow users to quickly search and download thousands of\ntrials, including anonymized patient-level information. These data sets\ntend to include control-arm data, which can be used to understand\nprognostic disease populations construct historical controls for\nexisting trials. However, some also include treatment data, which can be\nused to characterize predictive patient subtypes for a given treatment,\nunderstand safety profiles for classes of drugs, and aid in the design\nof new trials. We note that, for oncology, Project Data Sphere (Project data sphere: Convener, collaborator,\ncatalyst in the fight against cancer 2020) and outside of\noncology, Immport (Immport: Bioinformatics for the\nfuture of immunology 2020) have been invaluable in our own\nexperience by facilitating these types of analyses.\nClinical trial analysis data\nsets\nDuring a clinical trial, patient-level data is collected in case\nreport forms (CRFs). The format and data collected in these forms are\nprescribed in the trial design. These forms are the basis for the\nconstruction of analysis data sets and other documents that will be\nsubmitted to governing bodies, including the Food and Drug Association\n(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), for approval if the sponsor\n(party funding the trial) decides it is appropriate. The Clinical Data\nInterchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) (Clinical\ndata interchange standards consortium 2020) develops\nstandards dealing with medical research data, including the submission\nof trial results. Adhering to these standards is necessary for a\nsuccessful trial submission.\nThere are several data sets included with a submission that tend to\nbe useful for analysis. This paper focuses on the Analysis Data Model\n(ADaM) data, which provides patient-level data, which has been validated\nand used for data derivation and analysis. An ADaM data set is itself\ncomposed of several data sets, including a Subject-Level Analysis Data\nSet (ADSL) holding analysis and treatment information. Other\ninformation, including baseline characteristics, demographic data, visit\ninformation, etc., are held in the and Basic Data Structure (BDS)\nformatted data sets. Finally, adverse events are held in the Analysis\nData Sets for Adverse Events (ADAE).\nChallenges to analyzing\nthese data sets\nADaM data for a clinical trial is generally made available as a set\nof SAS7BDAT (Shotwell et al.\n2013) files. While neither the FDA nor the EMA require this\nformat for submission nor do they requires the use of SAS (SAS Institute 2020) for analysis, there\nis a heavy bias toward the data format and computing platform. This is\npartially because they are validated and approved by governing bodies\nand because a large effort has gone into their use in submissions.\nPackages like sas7bdat (Shotwell 2014) and, more recently, haven (Wickham and Miller\n2020) have gone a long way to make these data sets easily\naccessible to R (R Core Team 2012) users working with\nclinical trial data.\nDespite the effort that has gone into defining a structure for the\ndata as well as the tools implemented to aid in their analysis, the data\nsets themselves are not particularly easy to analyze for two reasons.\nFirst, the standard is not “tidy” as defined by Wickham et al. (2014). In particular, it is not required\nthat each variable forms a column. In fact, multiple variables may be\nstored in one column, with another column acting as a key as to which\nvariable’s value is given. This case is often seen in the ADSL data set\nwhere a single column may primary and secondary endpoints. For data sets\nlike these, the value variable is held in the Analysis Value (AVAL) if\nthe corresponding variable is numeric, Analysis Value Character (AVALC)\nif the variable is a string, the Parameter Character Description\n(PARAMCD) column giving a shorted variable name, and the Parameter\ncolumn providing a text description of the variable. As an example,\nconsider the adakiep.xpt data set, which is provided as an\nexample on the CDISC website and whose data is included in the\nsupplementary material.\n\n\nlibrary(readr)\n\nadakiep <- read_csv(\"adakiep.csv\") \nadakiep\n\n\n# A tibble: 24 × 8\n   USUBJID     PARAM      PARAMCD AVALC   ADY ADT        SRCDOM SRCSEQ\n   <chr>       <chr>      <chr>   <chr> <dbl> <date>     <chr>   <dbl>\n 1 XYZ-001-001 Death      DEATH   Y        85 2013-11-02 DS          1\n 2 XYZ-001-001 Dialysis   DIALYS… Y        80 2013-10-29 PR          2\n 3 XYZ-001-001 eGFR 25 P… EGFRDEC N        85 2013-11-02 <NA>       NA\n 4 XYZ-001-001 Composite… AKIEP   Y        80 2013-10-29 <NA>       NA\n 5 XYZ-001-002 Death      DEATH   Y        82 2015-03-20 DS          1\n 6 XYZ-001-002 Dialysis   DIALYS… Y        73 2015-03-11 PR          2\n 7 XYZ-001-002 eGFR 25 P… EGFRDEC N        82 2015-03-20 <NA>       NA\n 8 XYZ-001-002 Composite… AKIEP   Y        73 2015-03-11 <NA>       NA\n 9 XYZ-001-003 Death      DEATH   N        94 2010-10-12 DS          1\n10 XYZ-001-003 Dialysis   DIALYS… Y        64 2010-09-12 PR          2\n# … with 14 more rows\n\nThe data set includes minimal information about the trial. However,\nwe can infer that it is from a study focusing on kidney disease. There\nare four distinct endpoints, death, whether dialysis was needed, whether\na 25% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate, indicating a\ndecrease in kidney function. For analysis, these data will need to be\nre-arranged so that each endpoint has it’s own column along with another\ncolumn per endpoint indicating the trial day where the measurement was\ntaken (from the ADY column).\nThe task of transforming these types of data into into appropriate\nanalysis is complicated by the fact that there may be other files with\nrelevant information with similar layout or layouts slightly more\ncomplicated if they include longitudinal information, for example. The\nrest of this paper focuses on shaping these types of data so that they\ncan be quickly understood; they are amenable to many different types of\nanalyses at the individual patient level; and they can be reformatted\nfor an even larger class of analyses through a minimal set of verbs,\nincluding cohorting, which is introduced in this paper and is\nimplemented in the forceps package (Kane 2020). The package is currently in\ndevelopment and has not been released to CRAN. However, it has been\ntagged for prerelease on Github and can be installed with the following\ncode.\n\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"kaneplusplus/forceps@v0.0.5\")\n\n\n\nThe next section specifies the target data shape, which can be\nthought of as a restriction on the tidy format. The following section\nspecifies the steps needed to prepare clinical trial data so that it\nconforms to this restriction and includes an anonymized trial example.\nThe final section provides a roadmap if near-term development as well as\ndirections for enhancements and integration of the larger R\necosystem.\nA\ntidy representation for a consolidated analysis data set\nClinical trial data is collected to be used in an analysis that\ndetermines whether or not a treatment for a disease provides a benefit\nwhen compared to those receiving either a placebo or the standard of\ncare. “Benefit” is quantified by one or more endpoints, defined before\nthe trial starts (in the design), which are compared across\narms (treatment and placebo) at the conclusion of the trial using a\nstatistical test. These data provide a wealth of information, and their\nusefulness extends well beyond the scope of the trial. For example, they\ncan also be used to understand prognostic characteristics of the\ndisease-population; they can be used to create a ``historical control’’\nfor another trial; they can be used to identify patients’\ncharacteristics associated with better outcomes, etc.\nAs shown in the previous section, while ADaM-formatted data is\nstructured, the structure does not lend itself to analysis without first\nperforming some data transformations. We propose that the result of\nthese transformations is a single data set with the following\ncharacteristics.\nEach row corresponds to a single patient.\nA variable with one value per patient should be included as a column\nvariable.\nLongitudinal, time series, or repeated measures data should be\nstored as an embedded data.frame per subject.\nData conforming to these characteristics provide several advantages\nto ADaM data sets. First, they are oriented towards trial analysis.\nEssentially, trials compare response rates between treatment and control\narms. Having those values coded as their own variables in a single data\nset minimizes the complexity and effort that would otherwise go into\nextracting data from multiple files, cleaning them and joining them.\nSecond, it minimizes the reshaping effort for other types of analyses.\nFor example, response rates are often analyzed by the site at which\npatient measurements were taken in order to check for certain types of\nenrollment heterogeneity. The described patient-centric format can be\ntransformed into a site-centric format by nesting or grouping on a site\nvariable followed by the extraction of site-specific features and\nanalyses, which can then be compared across sites. Transforming between\nthese formats requires a single operation. Likewise, the patient-centric\nformat can be transformed to a patient-longitudinal format by unnesting\non the embedded variable holding the relevant longitudinal information.\nThird and finally, creating a single patient-centric data set minimizes\nthe chance of inconsistent analyses. Primary and secondary analyses\noften use similar variables and may require similar preprocessing. If\nthese preprocessing steps are performed separately for parallel\nanalyses, then the probability that at least one of them contains an\nerror in these steps is greater than when a validated patient-centric\ndata set is created. It also makes it easier to provide provenance for\nan analysis if they are dependent on the same preprocessed data.\nProcessing\nADaM data to reach the tidy representation\nThis section provides an example of how to use the functionality\nprovided in the forceps package, in the order that the\noperations take place. The data set is provided with the package, and\nthe variable names are taken from several example lung cancer studies.\nThe data set has been significantly reduced in size, and some values and\nvariable names have been preprocessed. This allows the example to remain\neasy to follow. It also allows us to illustrate the formation of a\npatient-centric data set in a single pass. In practice, this is often an\niterative process, requiring several revisions as bugs are found, and\nhypotheses change.\nThe data sets used are as follows, and the task will be to create a\npatient-centered data set as described above.\nlc_adverse_events - adverse events longitudinal\ndata.\nlc_biomarkers - patient biomarkers.\nlc_demography - patient demographic information.\nlc_adsl - response data.\nCreating the data dictionary\nSAS ADaM formatted data sets generally include extra information\nabout variables, including a short description of each of the variables\nand possibly formatting information. The haven package\nkeeps this as attributes of each of the columns of a tibble\nthat is read from these files. The forceps package is\ncapable of extracting this meta-information to create a\ntibble that can be used as a data dictionary using the\nconsolidated_describe_data() function, shown below. In\npractice, we have found it helpful as a starting for a fuller\ndescription of the data and often add columns to further categorize\nindividual variables for analyses.\n\n\nlibrary(forceps)\n\ndata(lc_adverse_events)\ndata(lc_biomarkers)\ndata(lc_demography)\ndata(lc_adsl)\n\nconsolidated_describe_data(lc_adverse_events,\n                           lc_biomarkers,\n                           lc_demography,\n                           lc_adsl)\n\n\n# A tibble: 27 × 5\n   var_name      type      label                format_sas data_source\n   <chr>         <chr>     <chr>                <chr>      <chr>      \n 1 usubjid       double    Randomization Code   <NA>       lc_adverse…\n 2 ae            character AE Preferred Term    character  lc_adverse…\n 3 ae_type       character System Organ Class 1 character  lc_adverse…\n 4 grade         integer   Adverse Event Grade? numeric    lc_adverse…\n 5 ae_day        double    Days From First Dos… <NA>       lc_adverse…\n 6 ae_duration   double    Adverse Event Durat… numeric    lc_adverse…\n 7 ae_treat      logical   Was the Adverse Eve… logical    lc_adverse…\n 8 ae_count      integer   Total Patient Adver… integer    lc_adverse…\n 9 usubjid       double    Randomization Code   <NA>       lc_biomark…\n10 egfr_mutation character EGFR Mutation +ve/-… character  lc_biomark…\n# … with 17 more rows\n\nCohorting\nThe data dictionary (or data description) provides a summary of the\nvariable types and information held by variables in each of the data\nsets. Some data sets will include repeated, longitudinal, or time series\ninformation about individual patients, like\nlc_adverese_events in our example. Consolidating data sets\nlike these into a single, patient-centric data set generally involves\nthree distinct operations. The first can be thought of as\npivot_wider() operations that take columns composed of\nmultiple variables and spread them across new columns in the data set.\nThe second takes the data set and nest()’s the data so that\nthe the resulting data set contains time-varying data embedded in a\ndata.frame variable and those variables that are repeated\nappear once per patient in the new variables. This verb, which is\nreferred to as cohort() in the package, takes the variable\nto cohort on (the usubjid in the example below), checks for\nvalues that are repeated by the subject identifier\n(ae_count in the example below) and those that are not, and\nhandles the nesting appropriately. A final operation may be applied to\nthe patient-level embedded data.frame objects to extract\nother features that will be used in subsequent analyses.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata(lc_adverse_events)\n\nlc_adverse_events %>% head()\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  usubjid ae        ae_type grade ae_day ae_duration ae_treat ae_count\n    <dbl> <chr>     <chr>   <int>  <dbl>       <dbl> <lgl>       <int>\n1    1003 BURNING … NERVOU…     1     27           4 FALSE          15\n2    1003 CONSTIPA… GASTRO…     2      4           4 TRUE           15\n3    1003 DEPRESSI… PSYCHI…     2     66          NA FALSE          15\n4    1003 BACK PAIN MUSCUL…     2     27          NA TRUE           15\n5    1003 DYSURIA   RENAL …     2      1           3 TRUE           15\n6    1003 SKIN EXF… SKIN A…     1      5          26 FALSE          15\n\nlc_adverse_events <- lc_adverse_events %>%\n  cohort(on = \"usubjid\", name = \"ae_long\")\n\nlc_adverse_events %>% head()\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  usubjid ae_count ae_long          \n    <dbl>    <int> <list>           \n1    1003       15 <tibble [15 × 6]>\n2    1005       19 <tibble [19 × 6]>\n3    1006       11 <tibble [11 × 6]>\n4    1009       12 <tibble [12 × 6]>\n5    1014        5 <tibble [5 × 6]> \n6    1018       10 <tibble [10 × 6]>\n\nIdentifying conflicts\nand redundancies\nAfter cohorting, each of the data sets is in the specified format,\nand we are almost ready to combine them. It is important to first check\nto see if there are variables that are repeated across the individual\ndata sets and detect conflicts. While ADaM data sets should be\nfree of conflicts and redundancies, we have observed multiple cases\nwhere this is not true. In order to identify these issues, the\nduplicate_vars() function is provided. The function checks\nthe column names of each of the data sets with those of other column\nnames. The object returned is a named list where the name corresponds to\nthe variable that is repeated. Each list element returns a\ntibble, joined by the on parameter with\ncolumns corresponding to the on variable, the duplicated\nvariable, the data sets where the duplicated variable appears. The\nexample below shows that the chemo_stop variable appears in\nthe demography and adsl data sets.\nFurthermore, we can see that the values in each of the data sets are\ndifferent by looking at the correspondence between the\ndemography and adsl columns. To fix this and\nmove on, we will remove the variable from the demography\ndata set.\n\n\ndata(lc_adsl)\ndata(lc_biomarkers)\ndata(lc_demography)\ndata_list <- list(demography = lc_demography, \n                  biomarkers = lc_biomarkers, \n                  adverse_events = lc_adverse_events, \n                  adsl = lc_adsl)\nduplicated_vars(data_list, on = \"usubjid\")\n\n\n$chemo_stop\n# A tibble: 558 × 4\n   usubjid var        demography            adsl                 \n     <dbl> <chr>      <chr>                 <chr>                \n 1    1003 chemo_stop patient discontinued  adverse events       \n 2    1005 chemo_stop treatment ineffective adverse events       \n 3    1006 chemo_stop <NA>                  treatment ineffective\n 4    1009 chemo_stop treatment ineffective <NA>                 \n 5    1014 chemo_stop <NA>                  adverse events       \n 6    1018 chemo_stop treatment ineffective treatment ineffective\n 7    1023 chemo_stop <NA>                  adverse events       \n 8    1025 chemo_stop adverse events        adverse events       \n 9    1030 chemo_stop adverse events        adverse events       \n10    1033 chemo_stop adverse events        treatment ineffective\n# … with 548 more rows\n\ndata_list$demography <- data_list$demography %>% \n  select(-chemo_stop)\n\n\n\nConsolidating\nThe last step is to consolidate the data sets into a single one. This\nis accomplished by reducing the data_list using full joins,\nalong with some extra checking. The consolidate() function\nwraps this functionality.

Admittedly, this only serves\nto mitigate the process of preparing these types of data for exploration\nand analysis. Clinical trial data generally contains many more variables\nthan what was presented, and each of these data sets comes with its own\nset of “quirks” and other challenges. However, it does serve to make the\ndata preparation better defined and propose a path toward\nstandardization of both the processed data set format as well as the\noperations to achieve that goal.\nAlong with further development towards those ends, there is a\nplethora of development that can be done to provide an integrated data\nprocessing experience. For example, the define.xml file, which appears\nalongside ADaM data sets, gives better descriptions of the variables as\nwell as the variable values. Tools to integrate these data into the\nconstruction of the data dictionary would go a long way towards\norienting researchers with the data contained and help them more quickly\nformulate analyses. Packages like lumberjack (van der Loo 2020) could enhance and\naugment data preprocessing steps by keeping better track of when data\nare being removed and how they are being manipulated. The artifacts\naccumulated could then be used by packages such as ggconsort (Higgins 2020) to\nprovide consort diagrams of how patients progress through the trial and\nhow data progresses through preprocessing. In the longer term, these\nadvancements can provide better data provenance, more reproducible\nprocessing, quicker debugging of problems in the processing stage, and\ngive rise to more effective and convenient tools for summarizing trial\ndata.\n\nCRAN Task Views implied\nby cited packages\n\n\nClinical data interchange standards\nconsortium. 2020.

Regularized transformation models unify many existing and novel regularized regression\n models under one theoretical and computational framework. Regularization strategies implemented\n for transformation models in tramnet include the Lasso, ridge regression, and the elastic net and\n follow the parameterization in glmnet. Several functionalities for optimizing the hyperparameters,\n including model-based optimization based on the mlrMBO package, are implemented. A multitude\n of S3 methods is deployed for visualization, handling, and simulation purposes. This work aims at\n illustrating all facets of tramnet in realistic settings and comparing regularized transformation models\n with existing implementations of similar models.",

Nonparametric estimators for the cure probability and the latency as\n functions of a covariate are provided.

    "description": "Chaos theory has been hailed as a revolution of thoughts and attracting ever-increasing\n attention of many scientists from diverse disciplines. Chaotic systems are non-linear deterministic\n dynamic systems which can behave like an erratic and apparently random motion. A relevant field\n inside chaos theory is the detection of chaotic behavior from empirical time-series data. One of the\n main features of chaos is the well-known initial-value sensitivity property. Methods and techniques\n related to testing the hypothesis of chaos try to quantify the initial-value sensitive property estimating\n the so-called Lyapunov exponents. This paper describes the main estimation methods of the Lyapunov\n exponent from time series data. At the same time, we present the DChaos library. R users may\n compute the delayed-coordinate embedding vector from time series data, estimates the best-fitted\n neural net model from the delayed-coordinate embedding vectors, calculates analytically the partial\n derivatives from the chosen neural nets model.

    "description": "The bestNormalize R package was designed to help users find a transformation that can effectively normalize a vector regardless of its actual distribution. Each of the many normalization techniques that have been developed has its own strengths and weaknesses, and deciding which to use until data are fully observed is difficult or impossible. This package facilitates choosing between a range of possible transformations and will automatically return  the best one, i.e., the one that makes data look the *most* normal. To evaluate and compare  the normalization efficacy across a suite of possible transformations, we developed a  statistic based on a goodness of fit test divided by its degrees of freedom.  Transformations can be seamlessly trained and applied to newly observed data  and can be implemented in conjunction with caret and recipes for  data preprocessing in machine learning workflows.

    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nThe bestNormalize\npackage contains a suite of transformation-estimating functions that can\nbe used to normalize data. The function of the same name attempts to\nfind and execute the best of all of these potential normalizing\ntransformations. In this package, we define “normalize” as in “to render\ndata Gaussian”, rather than transform them to a specific scale.\nThere are many instances where researchers may want to normalize a\nvariable. First, there is the (often problematic) assumption of\nnormality of the outcome (conditional on the covariates) in the\nclassical linear regression problem. Over the years, many methods have\nbeen used to relax this assumption: generalized linear models, quantile\nregression, survival models, etc. One technique that is still somewhat\npopular in this context is to “beat the data” to look normal via some\nkind of normalizing transformation. This could be something as simple as\na log transformation or something as complex as a Yeo-Johnson\ntransformation (yeojohnson?). In fact,\nmany complex normalization methods were designed expressly to find a\ntransformation that could render regression residuals Gaussian. While\nperhaps not the most elegant solution to the problem, often, this\ntechnique works well as a quick solution. Another increasingly popular\napplication of normalization occurs in applied regression settings with\nhighly skewed distributions of the covariates (Kuhn and Johnson 2013). In these\nsettings, there exists the tendency to have high leverage points (and\nhighly influential points), even when one centers and scales the\ncovariates. When examining interactions, these influential points can\nbecome especially problematic since the leverage of that point gets\namplified for every interaction in which it is involved. Normalization\nof such covariates can mitigate their leverage and influence, thereby\nallowing for easier model selection and more robust downstream predictor\nmanipulations (such as principal components analysis), which can\notherwise be sensitive to skew or outliers. As a result, popular model\nselection packages such as caret (Kuhn 2017) and recipes (Kuhn and Wickham 2018) have built-in\nmechanisms to normalize the predictor variables (they call this\n“preprocessing”). This concept is unique in that it forgoes the\nassumption of linearity between the outcome (Y) and the covariate,\nopting instead for a linear relationship between Y and the transformed\nvalue of the covariate (which in many cases may be more plausible).\nThis package is designed to make normalization effortless and\nconsistent. We have also introduced Ordered Quantile (ORQ) normalization\nvia the function, which uses a rank mapping of the observed data to the\nnormal distribution in order to guarantee normally distributed\ntransformed data (if ties are not present). We have shown how ORQ\nnormalization performs very consistently across different distributions,\nsuccessfully normalizing left- or right-skewed data, multi-modal data,\nand even data generated from a Cauchy distribution (Peterson and Cavanaugh 2019).\nIn this paper, we describe our R package bestNormalize, which is available via the Comprehensive R\nArchive Network (CRAN). First, we describe normalization methods that\nhave been developed and that we implement in the package. Second, we\ndescribe the novel cross-validation-based estimation procedure, which we\nutilize to judge the normalization efficacy of our suite of\nnormalization transformations. Third, we go through some basic examples\nof bestNormalize functionality and a simple\nimplementation of our methods within the recipes\npackage. We illustrate a more in-depth use-case in a car pricing\napplication, performing a transform-both-sides regression as well as\ncomparing the performance of several predictive models fit via caret. Finally, we conclude by discussing the pros and cons\nof normalization in general and future directions for the package.\nNormalization methods\nMany normalization transformation functions exist, and though some\ncan be implemented well in existing R packages, bestNormalize puts them all under the same umbrella syntax.\nThis section describes each transformation contained in the bestNormalize suite.\nThe Box-Cox transformation\nThe Box-Cox transformation was famously proposed in Box and Cox (1964) and can be\nimplemented with differing syntax and methods in many existing packages\nin R (e.g., caret, MASS (Venables and Ripley 2002), and more). It\nis a straightforward transformation that typically only involves one\nparameter, \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\ng(x; \\lambda) = \\boldsymbol 1 _{(\\lambda \\neq 0)}\n\\frac{x^\\lambda-1}{\\lambda}\n+ \\boldsymbol 1_{(\\lambda = 0)} \\log x\\text{ ,}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) refers to the datum in\nits original unit (pre-transformation). Given multiple observations, the\n\\(\\lambda\\) parameter can be estimated\nvia maximum likelihood, and \\(x\\) must\nbe greater than zero.\nThe Yeo-Johnson\ntransformation\nThe Yeo-Johnson transformation (yeojohnson?) attempts\nto find the value of \\(\\lambda\\) in the\nfollowing equation that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler distance between\nthe normal distribution and the transformed distribution.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ng(x;\\lambda) &=\n\\boldsymbol 1 _{(\\lambda \\neq 0, x \\geq 0)}\n\\frac{(x+1)^\\lambda-1}{\\lambda} \\\\\n&+ \\boldsymbol 1_{(\\lambda = 0, x \\geq 0)} \\log (x+1) \\\\\n&+ \\boldsymbol 1_{(\\lambda \\neq 2, x < 0)}\n\\frac{(1-x)^{2-\\lambda}-1}{\\lambda - 2} \\\\\n&+ \\boldsymbol 1_{(\\lambda = 2, x < 0)} -\\log (1-x) \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis method has the advantage of working without having to worry\nabout the domain of \\(x\\). As with the\nBox-Cox \\(\\lambda\\), this \\(\\lambda\\) parameter can be estimated via\nmaximum likelihood.\nThe Lambert W x F\ntransformation\nThe Lambert W x F transformation, proposed in Goerg (2011) and implemented in the LambertW package,\nis essentially a mechanism that de-skews a random variable \\(X\\) using moments. The method is motivated\nby a system theory and is alleged to be able to transform any random\nvariable into any other kind of random variable, thus being applicable\nto a large number of contexts. One of the package’s main functions is ,\nwhich is similar in spirit to the purpose of this package. However, this\nmethod may not perform as well on certain shapes of distributions as\nother candidate transformations; see Peterson and Cavanaugh (2019) for some examples.\nThe transformation can handle three types of transformations: skewed,\nheavy-tailed, and skewed heavy-tailed. For more details on this\ntransformation, consult the LambertW documentation.bestNormalize While the transformations contained and\nimplemented by are reversible (i.e., 1-1), in rare circumstances, we\nhave observed that the function can yield non-reversible\ntransformations.\nThe Ordered Quantile\ntechnique\nThe ORQ normalization technique () is based on the following\ntransformation (originally discussed, as far as we can find, in Bartlett (1947) and\nfurther developed in Van der\nWaerden (1952)):\nLet \\(\\underline x\\) refer to the\noriginal data. Then the transformation is:\n\\[\ng(\\underline x) = \\Phi ^{-1} \\left(\\frac{\\text{rank} (\\underline x) -\n1/2}{\\text{length}(\\underline x) }\\right)\n\\]\nThis nonparametric transformation as defined works well on the\nobserved data, but it is not trivial to implement in modern settings\nwhere the transformation needs to be applied on new data; we discussed\nthis issue and our solution to it in Peterson and Cavanaugh (2019). Basically, on new data\nwithin the range of the original data, ORQ normalization will\nlinearly interpolate between two of the original data points. On new\ndata outside the range of the original data, the transformation\nextrapolates using a shifted logit approximation of the ranks to the\noriginal data. This is visualized below via the data set on the\nvariable.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ORQ normalization visualization on Fisher’s iris data.\n\n\n\nThe shifted logit extrapolation ensures that the function is 1-1 and\ncan handle data outside the original (observed) domain. The effects of\nthe approximation will usually be relatively minimal since we should not\nexpect to see many observations outside the observed range if the\ntraining set sample size is large relative to the test set. The ORQ\ntechnique will not guarantee a normal distribution in the presence of\nties, but it still could yield the best normalizing transformation when\ncompared to the other possible approaches. More information on ORQ\nnormalization can be found in Peterson and Cavanaugh (2019) or in the bestNormalize documentation.\nOther included\ntransformations\nIn addition to the techniques above, the bestNormalize package performs and evaluates:\n\\(\\log_b(x + a)\\) where \\(a = \\max(0, -\\min(x) + \\epsilon)\\) and\n\\(b = 10\\) by default\n\\(\\sqrt{x + a}\\) where \\(a = \\max(0, -\\min(x))\\) by default\n\\(\\exp(x)\\)\n\\(\\text {arcsinh}(x) = log(x + \\sqrt{x^2 +\n1})\\)\nOther not-included\ntransformations\nA range of other normalization techniques has been proposed that are\nnot included in this package (at the time of writing). These include\n(but are not limited to): Modified Box-Cox (Box and Cox 1964), Manly’s Exponential\n(Manly 1976), John/Draper’s Modulus (John and Draper 1980), and\nBickel/Doksum’s Modified Box-Cox (Bickel and Doksum 1981). However, it is\nstraightforward to add new transformations into the same framework as\nother included transformations; each one is treated as its own S3 class,\nso in order to add other transformations, all one must do is define a\nnew S3 class and provide the requisite S3 methods. To this end, we\nencourage readers to submit a pull request to the package’s GitHub\npage with new transformation techniques that could be then added as\na default in . Otherwise, in a later section, we show how users can\nimplement custom transformations alongside the default ones described\nabove.\nWhich\ntransformation “best normalizes” the data?\nThe function selects the best transformation according to an\nextra-sample estimate of the Pearson P statistic divided by its degrees\nof freedom (\\(DF\\)). This P statistic\nis defined as\n\\[\nP = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}\\text{ ,}\n\\]\nwhere \\(O_i\\) is the number\nobserved, and \\(E_i\\) is the number of\nexpected (under the hypothesis of normality) to fall into “bin” \\(i\\). The bins (or “classes”) are built such\nthat observations will fall into each one with equal probability under\nthe hypothesis of normality. A variety of alternative normality tests\nexist, but this particular one is relatively interpretable as a goodness\nof fit test, and the ratio \\(P/DF\\) can\nbe compared between transformations as an absolute measure of departure\nfrom normality. Specifically, if the data in question follow a normal\ndistribution, this ratio will be close to 1 or lower. The transformation\nwhich produces data with the lowest normality statistic is thus the most\neffective at normalizing the data, and gets selected by . The bestNormalize package utilizes nortest (Gross and Ligges 2015) to compute this\nstatistic; more information on its computation and degrees of freedom\ncan be found in D’Agostino (1986) and Thode (2002).\nNormality statistics for all candidate transformations can be\nestimated and compared with one simple call to , whose output makes it\neasy to see which transformations are viable and which are not. We have\nfound that while complicated transformations are often most\neffective and therefore selected automatically, sometimes a simple\ntransformation (e.g., the log or identity transforms) may be almost as\neffective, and ultimately the latter type will yield more interpretable\nresults.\nIt is worth noting that when the normality statistic is estimated on\nin-sample data, the ORQ technique is predestined to be most effective\nsince it is forcing its transformed data to follow a normal distribution\nexactly (Peterson and Cavanaugh\n2019). For this reason, by default, the function calculates\nan out-of-sample estimate for the \\(P/DF\\) statistic. Since this method\nnecessitates cross-validation, it can be computationally frustrating for\nthree reasons: (1) the results and the chosen transformation can depend\non the seed, (2) it takes considerably longer to estimate than the\nin-sample statistic, and (3) it is unclear how to choose the number of\nfolds and repeats.\nIn order to mediate these issues, we have built several features into\nbestNormalize. Issue (1) is only important for small\nsample sizes, and when it is a concern, the best transformations should\nlook similar to one another. We address two solutions to (2) in the next\nsection. In short, we have methods to parallelize or simplify the\nestimation of the statistic. For (3), we recommend 10-fold\ncross-validation with 5 repeats as the default, but if the sample is\nsmall, we suggest using 5 (or fewer) folds instead with more repeats;\naccurate estimation of \\(P/DF\\)\nrequires a relatively large fold size (as a rule of thumb, 20\nobservations per fold seems to be enough for most cases, but this\nunfortunately depends on the distribution of the observed data).\nSimple examples\nIn this section, we illustrate a simple use-case of the functions\nprovided in bestNormalize.\nBasic implementation\nFirst, we will generate and plot some skewed data:\n\n\nx <- rgamma(250, 1, 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Simulated skewed data for simple example.\n\n\n\nTo perform a suite of potential transformations and see how\neffectively they normalized this vector, simply call :\n\n\n(BNobject <- bestNormalize(x))\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 250 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (Pearson P / df, lower => more normal):\n - arcsinh(x): 1.7917\n - Box-Cox: 1.0442\n - Center+scale: 3.0102\n - Exp(x): 9.5306\n - Log_b(x+a): 1.7072\n - orderNorm (ORQ): 1.1773\n - sqrt(x + a): 1.144\n - Yeo-Johnson: 1.1875\nEstimation method: Out-of-sample via CV with 10 folds and 5 repeats\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\nStandardized Box Cox Transformation with 250 nonmissing obs.:\n Estimated statistics:\n - lambda = 0.3254863 \n - mean (before standardization) = -0.3659267 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.9807881 \n\nEvidently, the Box-Cox transformation performed the best, though many\nother transformations performed similarly. We can visualize the suite of\ntransformations using the built-in method:\n\n\nplot(BNobject, leg_loc = \"topleft\")\n\n\n\nbestNormalize\n\nFigure 3: The suite of transformations estimated by default in bestNormalize (trained on simulated right-skewed data).\n\n\n\nFinally, we can execute the best performing normalization on new data\nwith or reverse the transformation with . Note that normalized values\ncan either be obtained using or by extracting from the object. The best\ntransformation, in this case, is plotted in Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Summary of transformations performed on simulated\nright-skewed data.\n\n\n\nPerforming\ntransformations individually\nEach method can be performed (and stored) individually:\n\n\n(arcsinh_obj <- arcsinh_x(x))\n\n\nStandardized asinh(x) Transformation with 250 nonmissing obs.:\n Relevant statistics:\n - mean (before standardization) = 0.7383146 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.5458515 \n\n(boxcox_obj <- boxcox(x))\n\n\nStandardized Box Cox Transformation with 250 nonmissing obs.:\n Estimated statistics:\n - lambda = 0.3254863 \n - mean (before standardization) = -0.3659267 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.9807881 \n\n(yeojohnson_obj <- yeojohnson(x))\n\n\nStandardized Yeo-Johnson Transformation with 250 nonmissing obs.:\n Estimated statistics:\n - lambda = -0.7080476 \n - mean (before standardization) = 0.4405464 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.2592004 \n\n(lambert_obj <- lambert(x, type = \"s\"))\n\n\nStandardized Lambert WxF Transformation of type s with 250 nonmissing obs.:\n Estimated statistics:\n - gamma = 0.3729\n - mean (before standardization) = 0.6781864 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.7123011 \n\n(orderNorm_obj <- orderNorm(x))\n\n\norderNorm Transformation with 250 nonmissing obs and no ties \n - Original quantiles:\n   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% \n0.001 0.268 0.721 1.299 4.161 \n\nAll normalization techniques in have their own class with convenient\nS3 methods and documentation. For instance, we can use the method to\nperform the transformation on new values using the objects we have just\ncreated, visualizing them in a plot:\n\n\nxx <- seq(min(x), max(x), length = 100)\nplot(xx, predict(arcsinh_obj, newdata = xx), type = \"l\", col = 1)\nlines(xx, predict(boxcox_obj, newdata = xx), col = 2)\nlines(xx, predict(yeojohnson_obj, newdata = xx), col = 3)\nlines(xx, predict(orderNorm_obj, newdata = xx), col = 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Manually plotting transformations trained on simulated\nright-skewed data.\n\n\n\nIn-sample normalization\nefficacy\nTo examine how each of the normalization methods performed\n(in-sample), we can visualize the transformed values in histograms\n(Figure 6), which plot the transformed data, , stored in the\ntransformation objects we created previously.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Normalized values for trained transformations on\nsimulated right-skewed data.\n\n\n\nEvidently, ORQ normalization appears to have worked perfectly to\nnormalize the data (as expected), and the Box-Cox method seemed to do\nquite well too.\nOut-of-sample\nnormalization efficacy\nThe function performs repeated (r=5) 10-fold cross-validation (CV) by\ndefault and stores the estimated normality statistic for each left-out\nfold/repeat into . Users can access and visualize these results via a\nboxplot (see below), which may give some insight into whether the\ntransformation is truly preferred by the normality statistic or if\nanother (possibly simpler) transformation can be applied that would\nachieve the approximately the same results. In this example, Box-Cox,\nsquare-root, Yeo-Johnson, and ORQ seem to do similarly well, whereas the\nidentity transform, hyperbolic arc-sine, logging, and exponentiation are\nperforming worse.\n\n\nboxplot(BNobject$oos_preds, log = 'y')\nabline(h = 1, col = \"green3\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Cross-validation results for each normalization method,\nwhere our estimated normality statistic is plotted on the y-axis.\n\n\n\nLeave-one-out CV can be optionally performed in via the argument,\nwhich, if set to , will compute the leave-one-out CV transformations for\neach observation and method. Specifically, will be run \\(n\\) separate times where each observation\nis individually left out of the fitting process and subsequently plugged\nback in to get a “leave-one-out transformed value”. Instead of taking\nthe mean across repeats and folds, in this case, we estimate\nnormalization efficacy using the full distribution of leave-one-out\ntransformed values. This option is computationally intensive. Note that\nas with the “in-sample” normality statistics, the leave-one-out CV\napproach tends to select the ORQ transformation since ORQ’s performance\nimproves as the number of points in the training set relative to the\ntesting set increases.\n\n\nbestNormalize(x, loo = TRUE)\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 250 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (Pearson P / df, lower => more normal):\n - arcsinh(x): 4.42\n - Box-Cox: 0.7055\n - Center+scale: 8.258\n - Exp(x): 62.085\n - Log_b(x+a): 3.546\n - orderNorm (ORQ): 0.012\n - sqrt(x + a): 0.9145\n - Yeo-Johnson: 1.608\nEstimation method: Out-of-sample via leave-one-out CV\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\norderNorm Transformation with 250 nonmissing obs and no ties \n - Original quantiles:\n   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% \n0.001 0.268 0.721 1.299 4.161 \n\nImportant features\nImproving speed of\nestimation\nBecause uses repeated CV by default to estimate the out-of-sample\nnormalization efficacy, it can be quite slow for larger objects. There\nare several means of speeding up the process. Each comes with some pros\nand cons. The first option is to specify . This will highly speed up the\nprocess. However, for reasons previously discussed, ORQ normalization\nwill always be chosen unless . Therefore, a user might as well use the\nfunction directly as opposed to only setting since the end result will\nbe the same (and will run much faster). Note below that the in-sample\nnormality results may differ slightly from the leave-one-out even when\nthis may be unexpected (i.e., for the log transformation); this is due\nto slight differences in the standardization statistics.\n\n\nbestNormalize(x, allow_orderNorm = FALSE, out_of_sample = FALSE)\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 250 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (Pearson P / df, lower => more normal):\n - arcsinh(x): 4.401\n - Box-Cox: 0.7435\n - Center+scale: 8.087\n - Exp(x): 64.6975\n - Log_b(x+a): 3.47\n - sqrt(x + a): 0.9145\n - Yeo-Johnson: 1.7125\nEstimation method: In-sample\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\nStandardized Box Cox Transformation with 250 nonmissing obs.:\n Estimated statistics:\n - lambda = 0.3254863 \n - mean (before standardization) = -0.3659267 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.9807881 \n\nAnother option to improve estimation efficiency is to use the\nbuilt-in parallelization functionality. The repeated CV process can be\nparallelized via the argument and the parallel and doRNG (Gaujoux 2020) packages. A cluster can be\nset up with and passed to via the argument.\n\n\ncl <- parallel::makeCluster(5)\nb <- bestNormalize(x, cluster = cl, r = 10, quiet = TRUE)\nparallel::stopCluster(cl)\n\n\n\nThe amount by which this parallelization will speed up the estimation\nof out-of-sample estimates depends (for the most part) on the number of\nrepeats, the number of cores, and the sample size of the vector to be\nnormalized. The plot below shows the estimation time for a run of with\n15 repeats of 10-fold CV on a gamma-distributed random variable with\nvarious sample sizes and numbers of cores.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Potential speedup using parallelization\nfunctionality.\n\n\n\nImplementation with caret,\nrecipes\nThe and the functions can be utilized in conjunction with the recipes package to preprocess data in machine learning\nworkflows with tidymodels\n(Kuhn and Wickham\n2020) or in combination with caret. The basic\nusage within recipes is shown below; for implementation\nwith caret, refer to this paper’s application.\n\n\nrec <- recipe( ~ ., data = iris)  %>%                       # Initialize recipe\n  step_best_normalize(all_predictors(), -all_nominal()) %>% # Transform predictors\n  prep(iris) %>%                                            # Prep (train) recipe\n  bake(iris)                                                # Bake (apply) recipe\n\n\n\nOptions can be supplied to to speed up or alter performance via the\nargument, which passes a list of options to .\nAdditional customization\nTwo important means of customization are available: 1) users may add\ncustom transformation functions to be assessed alongside the default\nsuite of normalization methods, and 2) users may change the statistic\nused “under the hood” by to estimate the departure from normality of the\ntransformed data. This section contains examples and guidance for both\nextensions.\n1) Adding user-defined\nfunctions\nVia the argument, users can use ’s machinery to compare custom,\nuser-defined transformation functions to those included in the package.\nBelow, I consider an example where a user may wish to compare the\ncube-root function with those provided in the package. requires two\nfunctions to implement this: the transformation function and an\nassociated method. The custom cube-root transformation shown below is\nsimple, but its skeleton can readily be made arbitrarily more\ncomplex.\n\n\n## Define custom function\ncuberoot_x <- function(x, ...) {\n  x.t <- (x)^(1/3)\n  \n  # Get in-sample normality statistic results\n  ptest <- nortest::pearson.test(x.t)\n  \n  val <- list(\n    x.t = x.t,\n    x = x,\n    n = length(x.t) - sum(is.na(x)), \n    norm_stat = unname(ptest$statistic / ptest$df)\n  )\n  \n  # Assign class, return\n  class(val) <- c('cuberoot_x')\n  val\n}\n\n# S3 method that is used to apply the transformation to newly observed data\npredict.cuberoot_x <- function(object, newdata = NULL, inverse = FALSE, ...) {\n  \n  # If no data supplied and not inverse\n  if (is.null(newdata) & !inverse)\n    newdata <- object$x\n  \n  # If no data supplied and inverse transformation is requested\n  if (is.null(newdata) & inverse)\n    newdata <- object$x.t\n  \n  # Perform inverse transformation\n  if (inverse) {\n    # Reverse-cube-root (cube)\n    val <-  newdata^3\n    \n    # Otherwise, perform transformation as estimated\n  } else if (!inverse) {\n    val <- (newdata)^(1/3)\n  }\n  \n  # Return transformed data\n  unname(val)\n}\n\n## Optional: print S3 method\nprint.cuberoot_x <- function(x, ...) {\n  cat('cuberoot(x) Transformation with', x$n, 'nonmissing obs.\\n')\n}\n\n\n\nThese functions can then be passed as a named list to :\n\n\ncustom_transform <- list(\n  cuberoot_x = cuberoot_x,\n  predict.cuberoot_x = predict.cuberoot_x,\n  print.cuberoot_x = print.cuberoot_x\n)\n\nset.seed(123129)\nx <- rgamma(100, 1, 1)\n(b <- bestNormalize(x = x, new_transforms = custom_transform))\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 100 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (Pearson P / df, lower => more normal):\n - arcsinh(x): 1.2347\n - Box-Cox: 1.0267\n - Center+scale: 2.0027\n - cuberoot_x: NA\n - Exp(x): 4.7947\n - Log_b(x+a): 1.3547\n - orderNorm (ORQ): 1.1627\n - sqrt(x + a): 1.0907\n - Yeo-Johnson: 1.0987\nEstimation method: Out-of-sample via CV with 10 folds and 5 repeats\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\nStandardized Box Cox Transformation with 100 nonmissing obs.:\n Estimated statistics:\n - lambda = 0.3281193 \n - mean (before standardization) = -0.1263882 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.9913552 \n\nEvidently, the cube-root was the best normalizing transformation for\nthis gamma-distributed random variable, performing comparably to the\nBox-Cox transformation.\n2) Re-defining normality\nThe question “what is normal?” outside of a statistical discussion is\nquite loaded and subjective. Even in statistical discussions, many\nauthors have contributed to the question of how to best detect\ndepartures from normality; these solutions are diverse, and several have\nbeen implemented well in nortest already. In order to\naccommodate those with varying opinions on the best definition of\nnormality, we have included a feature that allows users to specify a\ncustom definition of a normality statistic. This customization can be\naccomplished via the argument, which takes a function that will then be\napplied in lieu of the Pearson test statistic divided by its degree of\nfreedom to assess normality.\nThe user-defined function must take an argument , which indicates the\ndata on which a user wants to evaluate the statistic.\nHere is an example using the Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)\nnormality test statistic:\n\n\nbestNormalize(x, norm_stat_fn = function(x) nortest::lillie.test(x)$stat)\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 100 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (using custom normalization statistic)\n - arcsinh(x): 0.1958\n - Box-Cox: 0.1785\n - Center+scale: 0.2219\n - Exp(x): 0.3299\n - Log_b(x+a): 0.1959\n - orderNorm (ORQ): 0.186\n - sqrt(x + a): 0.1829\n - Yeo-Johnson: 0.1872\nEstimation method: Out-of-sample via CV with 10 folds and 5 repeats\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\nStandardized Box Cox Transformation with 100 nonmissing obs.:\n Estimated statistics:\n - lambda = 0.3281193 \n - mean (before standardization) = -0.1263882 \n - sd (before standardization) = 0.9913552 \n\nHere is an example using the Lillifors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) normality\ntest’s -value:\n\n\n(dont_do_this <- bestNormalize(x, norm_stat_fn = function(x) nortest::lillie.test(x)$p))\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 100 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (using custom normalization statistic)\n - arcsinh(x): 0.4327\n - Box-Cox: 0.4831\n - Center+scale: 0.2958\n - Exp(x): 0.0675\n - Log_b(x+a): 0.3589\n - orderNorm (ORQ): 0.4492\n - sqrt(x + a): 0.4899\n - Yeo-Johnson: 0.4531\nEstimation method: Out-of-sample via CV with 10 folds and 5 repeats\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\nStandardized exp(x) Transformation with 100 nonmissing obs.:\n Relevant statistics:\n - mean (before standardization) = 6.885396 \n - sd (before standardization) = 13.66084 \n\nNote: will attempt to minimize this statistic by default, which is\ndefinitely not what you want to do when calculating the -value. This is\nseen in the example above, where the worst\nnormalization transformation, exponentiation, is chosen. In this case, a\nuser is advised to either manually select the best one or reverse their\ndefined normalization statistic (in this case by subtracting it from\n1):\n\n\nbest_transform <- names(which.max(dont_do_this$norm_stats))\ndo_this <- dont_do_this$other_transforms[[best_transform]]\nor_this <- bestNormalize(x, norm_stat_fn = function(x) 1-nortest::lillie.test(x)$p)\n\n\n\nA -value for normality should not be routinely used as the sole\nselector of a normalizing transformation. A normality test’s -value, as\na measure of the departure from normality, is confounded by the sample\nsize (a high sample size may yield strong evidence of a practically\ninsignificant departure from normality). Therefore, we suggest the\nstatistic used should estimate the departure from normality rather the\nstrength of evidence against normality (e.g., Royston 1991).\nApplication to Autotrader\ndata\nBackground\nThe data set was scraped from the autotrader website as part of\nthis package (and because at the time of data collection in 2017, the\npackage author needed to purchase a car). We apply the bestNormalize functionality to de-skew mileage, age, and\nprice in a pricing model.

Importantly, TBS\nregression can often (though not always) yield models that better\nsatisfy assumptions of linear regression and mitigate the influence of\noutliers/skew. This approach has been shown to be useful in shrinking\nthe size of prediction intervals while maintaining closer to nominal\ncoverage in this data set (Peterson and Cavanaugh 2019).\nFirst, we will normalize the outcome (price).\n\n\n(priceBN <- bestNormalize(autotrader$price))\n\n\nBest Normalizing transformation with 6283 Observations\n Estimated Normality Statistics (Pearson P / df, lower => more normal):\n - arcsinh(x): 3.8573\n - Box-Cox: 2.2291\n - Center+scale: 3.5532\n - Log_b(x+a): 3.8573\n - orderNorm (ORQ): 1.1384\n - sqrt(x + a): 2.1977\n - Yeo-Johnson: 2.2291\nEstimation method: Out-of-sample via CV with 10 folds and 5 repeats\n \nBased off these, bestNormalize chose:\norderNorm Transformation with 6283 nonmissing obs and ties\n - 2465 unique values \n - Original quantiles:\n   0%   25%   50%   75%  100% \n  722 11499 15998 21497 64998 \n\nWe can see that the estimated normality statistic for the ORQ\ntransformation is close to 1, so we know it is performing quite well\ndespite the ties in the data.

In\nsituations where units have meaning, normalizing prior to analysis can\ncontaminate the relationships suspected in the data and/or reduce\npredictive accuracy. Further, depending on the type of transformations\nused, interpreting regression coefficients post-transformation can be\ndifficult or impossible without using a figure since the transformation\nfunction itself will look completely different for different\ndistributions. So, while normalization transformations may well be able\nto increase the robustness of results and mitigate violations to the\nclassical linear regression assumption of Gaussian residuals, it is by\nno means a universal solution.\nOn the other hand, when hypotheses are exploratory or when data is of\npoor quality with high amounts of skew/outliers, normalization can be an\neffective means of mitigating downstream issues this can cause in the\nanalyses. For example, in machine learning contexts, some predictor\nmanipulations rely on second-order statistics (e.g., principal\ncomponents analysis or partial least squares), for which the variance\ncalculation can be sensitive to skew and outliers. Normalizing\ntransformations can improve the quality and stability of these\ncalculations. Similarly, predictor normalization reduces the tendency\nfor high-leverage points to have their leverage propagated into\nengineered features such as interactions or polynomials. Ultimately,\nthese benefits can often produce predictive models that are more robust\nand stable.\nWe focused on making this package useful in a variety of machine\nlearning workflows. We are enthusiastic in our support of bestNormalize, and will continue to maintain the package\nwhile it is found to be useful by R users. We hope to continue to build\nup the repertoire of candidate transformations using the same\ninfrastructure so that additional ones can be considered by default in\nthe future.\nReferences\n\nCRAN packages used\nbestNormalize,\ncaret, recipes, MASS, LambertW, nortest, parallel, doRNG, tidymodels, visreg, scales, ggplot2, mgcv, yardstick\nCRAN\nTask Views implied by cited packages\nSocialSciences,\nDistributions,\nEconometrics,\nEnvironmetrics,\nHighPerformanceComputing,\nMultivariate,\nTeachingStatistics,\nBayesian, Graphics, MachineLearning,\nNumericalMathematics,\nPhylogenetics,\nPsychometrics,\nRobust\n\n\nM.

The new method makes use of the representation of a risk or performance estimator as a summation of a time series of influence-function (IF) transformed returns, and computes estimator standard errors using a sophisticated method of estimating the spectral density at frequency zero of the time series of IF-transformed returns. Two additional packages used by RPESE are introduced, namely RPEIF which computes and provides graphical displays of the IF of risk and performance estimators, and RPEGLMEN which implements a regularized Gamma generalized linear model polynomial fit to the periodogram of the time series of the IF-transformed returns. A Monte Carlo study shows that the new method provides more accurate estimates of standard errors for risk and performance estimators compared to well-known alternative methods in the presence of serial correlation.",

    "title": "Visual Diagnostics for Constrained Optimisation with Application to Guided Tours",
    "description": "A guided tour helps to visualise high-dimensional data by showing low-dimensional projections along a projection pursuit optimisation path. Projection pursuit is a generalisation of principal component analysis in the sense that different indexes are used to define the interestingness of the projected data. While much work has been done in developing new indexes in the literature, less has been done on understanding the optimisation. Index functions can be noisy, might have multiple local maxima as well as an optimal maximum, and are constrained to generate orthonormal projection frames, which complicates the optimization. In addition, projection pursuit is primarily used for exploratory data analysis, and finding the local maxima is also useful. The guided tour is especially useful for exploration because it conducts geodesic interpolation connecting steps in the optimisation and shows how the projected data changes as a maxima is approached. This work provides new visual diagnostics for examining a choice of optimisation procedure based on the provision of a new data object which collects information throughout the optimisation. It has helped to diagnose and fix several problems with projection pursuit guided tour. This work might be useful more broadly for diagnosing optimisers and comparing their performance. The diagnostics are implemented in the R package [ferrn](https://github.com/huizezhang-sherry/ferrn).",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nVisualisation is widely used in exploratory data analysis (Tukey 1977; Unwin 2015; Healy 2018; Wilke\n2019). Presenting information in graphics often unveils\ninsights that would otherwise not be discovered and provides a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the problem at hand. Task-specific tools\nsuch as Li et al.\n(2020)\nshow how visualisation can be used to understand, for instance, the\nbehaviour of the optimisation for the example of neural network\nclassification models. However, no general visualisation tool is\navailable for diagnosing optimisation procedures. The work presented in\nthis paper brings visualization tools into optimisation problems with\nthe aim to better understand the performance of optimisers in\npractice.\nThe focus of this paper is on the optimisation problem arising in the\nprojection pursuit guided tour (Buja et al. 2005), an exploratory data\nanalysis technique used for detecting interesting structures in\nhigh-dimensional data through a set of lower-dimensional projections\n(Cook et al.\n2008). The goal of the optimisation is to identify the\nprojection, represented by the projection matrix, that gives the most\ninteresting low-dimensional view. A view is said to be interesting if it\ncan show some structures of the data that depart from normality, such as\nbimodality, clustering, or outliers.\nThe optimization challenges encountered in the projection pursuit\nguided tour problem are common to those of optimization in general.\nExamples include the existence of multiple optima (local and global),\nthe trade-off between computational burden and proximity to the optima,\nor dealing with noisy objective functions that might be non-smooth and\nnon-differentiable (Jones et al. 1998). The visualization\ntools, optimization methods, and conceptual framework presented in this\npaper can therefore be applied to other optimization problems.\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section\nprovides an overview of optimisation methods, specifically random search\nand line search methods. A review of the projection pursuit guided tour,\nan overview of the optimisation problem and, outlines of three existing\nalgorithms follows. The third section presents the new visual\ndiagnostics, including the design of a data structure to capture\ninformation during the optimisation, from which several diagnostic plots\nare created. An illustration of how the diagnostic plots can be used to\nexamine the performance of different optimisers and guide improvements\nto existing algorithms is shown using simulated data. Finally, an\nexplanation of the implementation in the R package, ferrn (Zhang et al. 2021), is provided.\nOptimisation methods\nThe type of optimisation problem considered in this paper is\nconstrained optimization (Bertsekas\n2014), assuming it is not possible to find a solution to the\nproblem in the way of a closed-form. That is, the problem consists in\nfinding the minimum or maximum of a function \\(f \\in L^p\\) in the constrained space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), where \\(L^p\\) defines the vector space of function\n\\(f\\), whose \\(p\\)th power is integrable.\nGradient-based methods are commonly used to optimise an objective\nfunction, with the most notable one being the gradient ascent (descent)\nmethod. Although these methods are popular, they rely on the\navailability of the objective function derivatives. As will be shown in\nthe next section, the independent variables in our optimisation problem\nare the entries of a projection matrix, and the computational time\nrequired to perform differentiation on a matrix could impede the\nrendering of tour animation. In addition, some objective functions rely\non the empirical distribution of the data, which makes it in general not\npossible to get the gradient. Hence, gradient-based methods are not the\nfocus of this paper, and consideration will be given to derivative-free\nmethods.\nDerivative-free methods (Conn et al.\n2009; Rios\nand Sahinidis 2013), which do not rely on the knowledge of\nthe gradient, are more generally applicable. Derivative-free methods\nhave been developed over the years, where the emphasis is on finding, in\nmost cases, a near-optimal solution. Here we consider three\nderivative-free methods, two of which are random search methods:\ncreeping random search and simulated annealing, and the other one is\npseudo-derivative search.\nRandom search methods (Romeijn 2009; Zabinsky\n2013; Andradóttir 2015) have a random sampling\ncomponent as part of their algorithms and have been shown to have the\nability to optimise non-convex and non-smooth functions. The initial\nrandom search algorithm, pure random search (Brooks 1958), draws candidate points\nfrom the entire space without using any information of the current\nposition and updates the current position when an improvement on the\nobjective function is made. As the dimension of the space becomes\nlarger, sufficient sampling from the entire space would require a long\ntime for convergence to occur, despite a guaranteed global convergence\n(Spall\n2005). Various algorithms have thus been developed to improve\npure random search by either concentrating on a narrower sampling space\nor using a different updating mechanism. Creeping random search (White 1971) is such a variation, where a\ncandidate point is generated within a neighbourhood of the current\npoint. This makes creeping random search faster to compute but global\nconvergence is no longer guaranteed. On the other hand, simulated\nannealing (Kirkpatrick\net al. 1983; Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis 1993),\nintroduces a different updating mechanism. Rather than only updating the\ncurrent point when an improvement is made, it uses a Metropolis\nacceptance criterion, where worse candidates still have a chance to be\naccepted. The convergence of simulated annealing algorithms has been\nwidely researched (Mitra et al.\n1986; Granville et al. 1994) and the global\noptimum can be attained under mild regularity conditions.\nThe pseudo-derivative search uses a common search scheme in\noptimisation: line search. In line search methods, users are required to\nprovide an initial estimate \\(x_{1}\\)\nand, at each iteration, a search direction \\(S_k\\) and a step size \\(\\alpha_k\\) are generated. Then one moves on\nto the next point following \\(x_{k+1} = x_k +\n\\alpha_kS_k\\) and the process is repeated until the desired\nconvergence is reached. In derivative-free methods, local information of\nthe objective function is used to determine the search direction. The\nchoice of step size also needs consideration, as inadequate step sizes\nmight prevent the optimisation method from converging to an optimum. An\nideal step size can be chosen by finding the value of \\(\\alpha_k \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) that maximises\n\\(f(x_k + \\alpha_kS_k)\\) with respect\nto \\(\\alpha_k\\) at each iteration.\nProjection pursuit guided\ntour\nA projection pursuit guided tour combines two different methods\n(projection pursuit and guided tour) to explore interesting features in\na high-dimensional space. Projection pursuit, coined by Friedman and Tukey\n(1974), detects interesting structures\n(e.g., clustering, outliers, and skewness) in multivariate data via\nlow-dimensional projections. Guided tour (Cook et al. 1995) is one variation of a\nbroader class of data visualisation methods, tour (Buja et al. 2005), which displays\nhigh-dimensional data through a series of animated projections.\nLet \\(\\mathbf{X}_{n \\times p}\\) be\nthe data matrix with \\(n\\) observations\nin \\(p\\) dimensions. A \\(d\\)-dimensional projection is a linear\ntransformation from \\(\\mathbb{R}^p\\)\ninto \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\) defined as \\(\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{X} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}\\),\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{n \\times d}\\) is\nthe projected data and \\(\\mathbf{A}_{p\\times\nd}\\) is the projection matrix. We define \\(f: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\mapsto\n\\mathbb{R}\\) to be an index function that maps the projected data\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) onto a scalar value.\nThis is commonly known as the projection pursuit index function, or just\nindex function, and is used to measure the “interestingness” of a given\nprojection. An interesting projection shows structures that are\nnon-normal since theoretical proofs from Diaconis and Freedman (1984) have shown that projections tend\nto be normal as \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) approach infinity under certain\nconditions. There have been many index functions proposed in the\nliterature, here are a few examples: early indexes that can be\ncategorised as measuring the \\(L^2\\)\ndistance between the projection and a normal distribution: Legendre\nindex (Friedman and\nTukey 1974); Hermite index (Hall 1989); natural Hermite index (Cook et al.\n1993); chi-square index (Posse 1995) for detecting spiral\nstructure; LDA index (Lee et al. 2005) and PDA (Lee and Cook\n2010) index for supervised classification; kurtosis index\n(Loperfido\n2020) and skewness index (Loperfido 2018) for detecting outliers\nin financial time series; and most recently, scagnostic indexes (Laa and Cook 2020) for summarising\nstructures in scatterplot matrices based on eight scagnostic measures\n(Wilkinson et al. 2005; Wilkinson and Wills 2008).\nAs a general visualisation method, tour produces animations of\nhigh-dimensional data via rotations of low-dimensional planes. There are\ndifferent versions depending on how the high-dimensional space is\ninvestigated: grand tour (Cook et al. 2008) selects the planes\nrandomly to provide a general overview; manual tour (Cook and Buja\n1997) gradually phases in and out one variable to understand\nthe contribution of that variable in the projection. Guided tour, the\nmain interest of this paper, chooses the planes with the aid of\nprojection pursuit to gradually reveal the most interesting projection.\nGiven a random start, projection pursuit iteratively finds bases with\nhigher index values, and the guided tour constructs a geodesic\ninterpolation between these planes to form a tour path. Figure\n1 shows a sketch of the tour path where the blue\nsquares represent planes (targets) selected by the projection pursuit\noptimisation, and the white squares represent planes in the geodesic\ninterpolation between targets. Mathematical details of the geodesic\ninterpolation can be found in Buja et al. (2005).\n(Note that the term frame used in Buja’s paper refers to a\nparticular set of orthonormal vectors defining a plane. This is also\nconventionally referred to as a basis, which is used in this paper and\nthe associated software.) The aforementioned tour method has been\nimplemented in the R package tourr (Wickham et al. 2011).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: An illustration for demonstrating the frames in a tour\npath. Each square (frame) represents the projected data with a\ncorresponding basis. Blue frames are returned by the projection pursuit\noptimisation and white frames are constructed between two blue frames by\ngeodesic interpolation.\n\n\n\nOptimisation in the tour\nIn projection pursuit, the optimisation aims at finding the global\nand local maxima that give interesting projections according to an index\nfunction. That is, it starts with a given randomly selected basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_1\\) and aims at finding an\noptimal final projection basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_T\\) that satisfies the following\noptimisation problem:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\arg \\max_{\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathcal{A}} f(\\mathbf{X} \\cdot\n\\mathbf{A})  ~~~ s.t. ~~~ \\mathbf{A}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A} = I_d \\,,\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere \\(f\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) are defined as in the previous\nsection, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is the set of\nall \\(p\\)-dimensional projection bases,\n\\(I_d\\) is the \\(d\\)-dimensional identity matrix, and the\nconstraint ensures the projection bases, \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), to be orthonormal. It is\nworth noticing the following: 1) The optimisation is constrained, and\nthe orthonormality constraint imposes a geometrical structure on the\nbases space: it forms a Stiefel manifold. 2) There may be index\nfunctions for which the objective function might not be differentiable.\n3) While finding the global optimum is the goal of the optimisation\nproblem, interesting projections may also appear in the local optimum.\n4) The optimisation should be fast to compute since the tour animation\nis viewed by the users during the optimisation.\nExisting algorithms\nThree optimisers have been implemented in the tourr\n(Wickham et al. 2011) package: creeping\nrandom search (CRS), simulated annealing (SA), and pseudo-derivative\n(PD). Creeping random search (CRS) is a random search optimiser that\nsamples a candidate basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) in the neighbourhood of\nthe current basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{cur}}\\) by \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l} = (1-\n\\alpha)\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{cur}} + \\alpha\n\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{rand}}\\) where \\(\\alpha \\in [0,1]\\) controls the radius of\nthe sampling neighbourhood and \\(\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{rand}}\\) is generated\nrandomly. \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) is then\northonormalised to fulfil the basis constraint. If \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) has an index value higher\nthan the current basis \\(\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{cur}}\\), the optimiser\noutputs \\(\\mathbf{A}_{l}\\) for a guided\ntour to construct an interpolation path. The neighbourhood parameter\n\\(\\alpha\\) is adjusted by a cooling\nparameter: \\(\\alpha_{j+1} = \\alpha_j *\n\\text{cooling}\\) before the next iteration starts. The optimiser\nterminates when the maximum number of iteration \\(l_{\\max}\\) is reached before a better basis\ncan be found. The algorithm of CRS can be found in the appendix. Posse (1995)\nhas proposed a slightly different cooling scheme by introducing a\nhalving parameter \\(c\\). In his\nproposal, \\(\\alpha\\) is only adjusted\nif the last iteration takes more than \\(c\\) times to find a better basis.\nSimulated annealing (SA) uses the same sampling process as CRS but\nallows a probabilistic acceptance of a basis with lower index value than\nthe current one. Given an initial value of \\(T_0 \\in \\mathbb{R^{+}}\\), the “temperature”\nat iteration \\(l\\) is defined as \\(T(l) = \\frac{T_0}{\\log(l + 1)}\\). When a\ncandidate basis fails to have an index value larger than the current\nbasis, SA gives it a second chance to be accepted with probability \\[P= \\min\\left\\{\\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\mid\nI_{\\text{cur}} - I_{l} \\mid}{T(l)}\\right],1\\right\\} \\,,\\] where\n\\(I_{(\\cdot)} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) denotes\nthe index value of a given basis. This implementation allows the\noptimiser to make a move and explore the basis space even if the\ncandidate basis does not have a higher index value. Hence it enables the\noptimiser to jump out of a local optimum. The second algorithm in the\nappendix highlights how SA differs from CRS in the inner loop.\nPseudo-derivative (PD) search uses a different strategy than CRS and\nSA. Rather than randomly sample the basis space, PD first computes a\nsearch direction by evaluating bases close to the current basis. The\nstep size is then chosen along the corresponding geodesic by another\noptimisation over a 90 degree angle from \\(-\\pi/4\\) to \\(\\pi/4\\). The resulting candidate basis\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_{**}\\) is returned for the\ncurrent iteration if it has a higher index value than the current one.\nThe third algorithm in the appendix summarises the inner loop of the\nPD.\nVisual diagnostics\nA data structure for diagnosing optimisers in projection pursuit\nguided tour is first defined. With this data structure, four types of\ndiagnostic plots are presented.\nData structure for\ndiagnostics\nThree main pieces of information are recorded during the projection\npursuit optimisation: 1) projection bases \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), 2) index values \\(I\\), and 3) state \\(S\\). For CRS and SA, possible states\ninclude random_search, new_basis, and\ninterpolation. Pseudo-derivative (PD) has a wider variety\nof states, including new_basis,\ndirection_search, best_direction_search,\nbest_line_search, and interpolation. Multiple\niterators index the information collected at different levels: \\(t\\) is a unique identifier prescribing the\nnatural ordering of each observation; \\(j\\) and \\(l\\) are the counter of the outer and inner\nloop, respectively. Other parameters of interest recorded, \\(V\\), include method that tags\nthe name of the optimiser, and alpha that indicates the\nsampling neighbourhood size for searching observations. A matrix\nnotation describing the data structure is:\n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)\n\\(I\\)\n\\(S\\)\n\\(j\\)\n\\(l\\)\n\\(V_{1}\\)\n\\(V_{2}\\)\nDescription\n\\(1\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_1\\)\n\\(I_1\\)\n\\(S_1\\)\n1\n1\n\\(V_{11}\\)\n\\(V_{12}\\)\nstart basis\n\\(2\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_2\\)\n\\(I_2\\)\n\\(S_2\\)\n2\n1\n\\(V_{21}\\)\n\\(V_{22}\\)\nsearch\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n2\n\\(l_2\\)\n…\n…\nsearch (accepted)\n…\n…\n…\n…\n2\n1\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n2\n\\(k_2\\)\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J\\)\n1\n…\n…\nsearch\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(T\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_T\\)\n\\(I_T\\)\n\\(S_T\\)\n\\(J\\)\n\\(l_J\\)\n\\(V_{T1}\\)\n\\(V_{T2}\\)\nsearch (final)\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J\\)\n1\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J\\)\n\\(k_J\\)\n…\n…\ninterpolation\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(J+1\\)\n1\n…\n…\nsearch (last round)\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\\(T^{\\prime}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{A}_{T^{\\prime}}\\)\n\\(I_{T^{\\prime}}\\)\n\\(S_{T^{\\prime}}\\)\n\\(J+1\\)\n\\(l_{J+1}\\)\n\\(V_{{T}^{\\prime}1}\\)\n\\(V_{{T}^{\\prime}2}\\)\nsearch (last round)\nwhere \\(T^{\\prime} = T + k_{J}+\nl_{J+1}\\). Note that there is no output in iteration \\(J + 1\\) since the optimiser does not find a\nbetter basis in the last iteration and terminates. The final basis found\nis \\(A_T\\) with index value \\(I_T\\).\nThe data structure constructed above meets the tidy data principle\n(Wickham\n2014) that requires each observation to form a row and each\nvariable to form a column. With tidy data structure, data wrangling and\nvisualisation can be significantly simplified by well-developed packages\nsuch as dplyr\n(Wickham et al. 2020) and ggplot2 (Wickham 2016).\nDiagnostic\n1: Checking how hard the optimiser is working\nA starting point of diagnosing an optimiser is to understand how many\nsearches it has conducted, i.e., we want to summarise how the index is\nincreasing over iterations and how many basis need to be sampled at each\niteration. This is achieved using the function\nexplore_trace_search(): a boxplot shows the distribution of\nindex values for each try, where the accepted basis (corresponding to\nthe highest index value) is always shown as a point. When there are only\nfew tries at a given iteration, showing the data points directly is\npreferred over the boxplot and this is controlled via the\ncutoff argument. Additional annotations are added to\nfacilitate better reading of the plot, and these include 1) the number\nof points searched in each iteration can be added as text label at the\nbottom of each iteration; 2) the anchor bases to interpolate are\nconnected and highlighted in a larger size; 3) the colour of the last\niteration is in greyscale to indicate no better basis found in this\niteration.\nFigure 2 shows an example of the search plot for\nCRS (left) and SA (right). Both optimisers quickly find better bases in\nthe first few iterations and then take longer to find one in the later\niterations. The anchor bases, the ones found with the highest index\nvalue in each iteration, always have an increased index value in the\noptimiser CRS while this is not the case for SA. This feature gives CRS\nan advantage in this simple example to quickly find the optimum.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A comparison of the searches by two optimisers: CRS\n(left) and SA (right) on a 2D projection problem of a six-variable\ndataset, using the holes index. Both optimisers reach the final basis\nwith a similar index value, while it takes SA longer to find the final\nbasis. In the earlier iterations, optimisers quickly find a better basis\nto proceed, while in the later iterations, most sampled bases fail to\nmake an improvement on the index value, and a boxplot is used to\nsummarise the distribution of the index values. There is no better basis\nfound in the last iteration, 9 (left) and 15 (right), before reaching\nthe maximum number of try and hence it is coloured grey. The colour\nscale is from the customised botanical palette in the\nferrn package.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 2: Examining the optimisation\nprogress\nAnother interesting feature to examine is the changes in the index\nvalue between interpolating bases since the projection on these bases is\nshown in the tour animation. Trace plots are created by plotting the\nindex value against time. Figure 3 presents the trace\nplot of the same optimisations as Figure 2, and one\ncan observe that the trace is smooth in both cases. It may seem bizarre\nat first sight that the interpolation sometimes passes bases with higher\nindex values before it decreases to a lower target. This happens\nbecause, on the one hand, the probabilistic acceptance in SA implies\nthat some worse bases will be accepted by the optimiser. In addition,\nthe guided tour interpolates between the current and target basis to\nprovide a smooth transition between projections, and sometimes a higher\nindex value will be observed along the interpolation path. This\nindicates that a non-monotonic interpolation cannot be avoided, even for\nCRS. Later, in Section A problem of non-monotonicity, there\nwill be a discussion on improving the non-monotonic interpolation for\nCRS.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: An inspection of the index values as the optimisation\nprogress for two optimisers: CRS (left) and SA (right). The holes index\nis optimised for a 2D projection problem on the six-variable dataset .\nLines indicate the interpolation, and dots indicate new target bases\ngenerated by the optimisers. Interpolation in both optimisation is\nsmooth, while SA is observed to first pass by some bases with higher\nindex values before reaching the target bases in time 76-130.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 3a: Understanding the optimiser’s coverage\nof the search space\nApart from checking the search and progression of an optimiser,\nlooking at where the bases are positioned in the basis space is also of\ninterest. Given the orthonormality constraint, the space of projection\nbases \\(\\mathbf{A}_{p \\times d}\\) is a\nStiefel manifold. For one-dimensional projections, this forms a \\(p\\)-dimensional sphere. A dimensionality\nreduction method, e.g., principal component analysis, is applied to\nfirst project all the bases onto a 2D space. In a projection pursuit\nguided tour optimisation, there are various types of bases involved: 1)\nThe starting basis; 2) The search bases that the optimiser evaluated to\nproduce the anchor bases; 3) The anchor bases that have the highest\nindex value in each iteration; 4) The interpolating bases on the\ninterpolation path; and finally, 5) the end basis. The importance of\nthese bases differs but the most important ones are the starting,\ninterpolating, and end bases. Sometimes, two optimisers can start with\nthe same basis but finish with bases of opposite signs. This happens\nbecause the projection is invariant to the orientation of the basis, and\nso is the index value. However, this creates difficulties for comparing\nthe optimisers since the end bases will be symmetric to the origin. A\nsign flipping step is conducted to flip the signs of all the bases in\none routine if different optimisations finish at opposite places.\nSeveral annotations have been made to help understand this plot. As\nmentioned previously, the original basis space is a high-dimensional\nsphere, and random bases on the sphere can be generated via the geozoo (Schloerke 2016) package. We use PCA to\nproject and visualize the parameters/ bases in 2D. The centre of the 2D\nview is the first two PCs of the data matrix. It theoretically should be\na circle but may have some irregular edges due to finite sampling. Thus\nthe edge is smoothed by using a radius estimated as the largest distance\nfrom the centre to any basis. In the simulation, the theoretical best\nbasis is known and can be labelled to compare how close to this that the\noptimisers stopped. Various aesthetics, i.e., size, alpha\n(transparency), and colour, are applicable to emphasize critical\nelements and adjust for the presentation. For example, anchor points and\nsearch points are less important, and hence a smaller size and alpha are\nused. Alpha can also be applied on the interpolation paths to show start\nto finish from transparent to opaque.\nFigure 4 shows the PCA plot of CRS and PD for a 1D\nprojection problem. Both optimisers find the optimum, but PD gets\ncloser. With the PCA plot, one can visually appreciate the nature of\nthese two optimisers: PD first evaluates points in a small neighbourhood\nfor a promising direction, while CRS evaluates points randomly in the\nsearch space to search for the next target. There are dashed lines\nannotated for CRS, and it describes the interruption of the\ninterpolation, which will be discussed in detail in Section A\nproblem of non-monotonicity.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Search paths of CRS (green) and PD (brown) in the\nPCA-reduced basis space for 1D projection problem on the five-variable\ndataset, using holes index. The basis space, a 5D unit sphere, is\nprojected onto a 2D circle by PCA. The black star represents the\ntheoretical best basis the optimisers are aiming to find. All the bases\nin PD have been flipped for easier comparison of the final bases, and a\ngrey dashed line has been annotated to indicate the symmetry of the two\nstart bases.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 3b:\nAnimating the diagnostic plots\nAnimation is another type of display to show how the search\nprogresses from start to finish in the space. Figure\n5 shows the animated version (six\nframes from the animation if viewed in pdf) of the PCA plot in Figure\n4. An additional piece of information one can learn from\nthis animation is that CRS finds its end basis quicker than PD since CRS\nfinishes its search in the 5th frame while PD is still making more\nprogress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Animated version of Figure 4. With\nanimation, the progression of the search paths from start to finish can\nbetter identified and CRS (green) finishes the optimisation quicker than\nPD (brown).\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 4a: The\ntour looking at itself\nAs mentioned previously, the original \\(p\n\\times d\\) dimension space can be simulated via randomly\ngenerated bases in the geozoo (Schloerke 2016) package. While the PCA\nplot projects the bases from the direction that maximises the variance,\nthe tour plot displays the original high-dimensional space from various\ndirections using animation. Figure 6 shows\nsome frames from the tour plot of the same two optimisations in its\noriginal space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Animating the two paths from Figure 4 and 5\nin the full basis space. The full basis space in this example is a 5D\nunit sphere, on which points (grey) are randomly generated via the CRAN\npackage geozoo.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic 4b: Forming a\ntorus\nWhile the previous few examples have looked at the space of 1D basis\nin a unit sphere, this section visualises the space of 2D basis. Recall\nthat the columns in a 2D basis are orthogonal to each other, so the\nspace of \\(p \\times 2\\) bases is a\ntorus in the \\(p\\)-D space (Buja and Asimov 1986). For \\(p = 3\\) one would see a classical 3D torus\nshape as shown by the grey points in Figure\n7. The two circles of the torus can be\nobserved to be perpendicular to each other and this can be linked back\nto the orthogonality condition. Two paths from CRS and PD are plotted on\ntop of the torus and coloured in green and brown, respectively, to match\nthe previous plots. The final basis found by PD and CRS are shown in a\nlarger shape and printed below, respectively:\n\n             [,1]        [,2]\n[1,]  0.001196285  0.03273881\n[2,] -0.242432715  0.96965761\n[3,] -0.970167484 -0.24226493\n\n\n            [,1]         [,2]\n[1,]  0.05707994 -0.007220138\n[2,] -0.40196202 -0.915510160\n[3,] -0.91387549  0.402230054\n\nBoth optimisers have found the third variable in the first direction\nand the second variable in the second direction. Note, however, the\ndifferent orientation of the basis, following from the different sign in\nthe second column. One would expect to see this in the torus plot as the\nfinal bases match each other when projected onto one torus circle (due\nto the same sign in the first column) and are symmetric when projected\nonto the other (due to the different sign in the second column). In\nFigure 7, this can be seen most clearly in\nframe 5 where the two circles are rotated into a line from our view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Animation of rotating the 2D basis space\nalong with two search paths optimised by PD (brown) and CRS (green). The\nprojection problem is a 2D projection with three variables using the\nholes index. The grey points are randomly generated 2D projection bases\nin the space and it can be observed that these points form a torus.\n\n\n\nDiagnosing an optimiser\nIn this section, several examples will be presented to show how the\ndiagnostic plots discover something unexpected in projection pursuit\noptimisation, and guide the implementation of new features.\nSimulation setup\nRandom variables with different distributions have been simulated as\nfollows:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nx_1 \\overset{d}{=} x_8 \\overset{d}{=} x_9 \\overset{d}{=} x_{10}&\n\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\\\\nx_2 &\\sim 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(-3, 1) + 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(3, 1)\\\\\n\\Pr(x_3) &=\n\\begin{cases}\n0.5 & \\text{if $x_3 = -1$ or $1$}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\\\\\nx_4 &\\sim 0.25 \\mathcal{N}(-3, 1) + 0.75 \\mathcal{N}(3, 1)\\\\\nx_5 &\\sim \\frac{1}{3} \\mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + \\frac{1}{3}\n\\mathcal{N}(0, 1) + \\frac{1}{3} \\mathcal{N}(5, 1)\\\\\nx_6 &\\sim 0.45 \\mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + 0.1 \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) + 0.45\n\\mathcal{N}(5, 1)\\\\\nx_7 &\\sim 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(-5, 1) + 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(5, 1)\n\\end{align}\\]\nVariables x1, x8 to x10 are\nnormal noise with zero mean, and unit variance and x2 to\nx7 are normal mixtures with varied weights and locations.\nAll the variables have been scaled to have overall unit variance before\nprojection pursuit. The holes index (Cook et al. 2008), used for detecting\nbimodality of the variables, is used throughout the examples unless\notherwise specified.\nA problem of non-monotonicity\nAn example of non-monotonic interpolation has been given in Figure\n3: a path that passes bases with a higher index value\nthan the target one. For SA, a non-monotonic interpolation is justified\nsince target bases do not necessarily have a higher index value than the\ncurrent one, while this is not the case for CRS. The original trace plot\nfor a 2D projection problem, optimised by CRS, is shown on the left\npanel of Figure 8, and one can observe that the\nnon-monotonic interpolation has undermined the optimiser to realise its\nfull potential. Hence, an interruption is implemented to stop at the\nbest basis found in the interpolation. The right panel of Figure\n8 shows the trace plot after implementing the\ninterruption, and while the first two interpolations are identical, the\nbasis at time 61 has a higher index value than the target in the third\ninterpolation. Rather than starting the next iteration from the target\nbasis on time 65, CRS starts the next iteration at time 61 on the right\npanel and reaches a better final basis.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Comparison of the interpolation before and after\nimplementing the interruption for the 2D projection problem on data\nusing holes index, optimised by CRS. On the left panel, the basis with a\nhigher index value is found during the interpolation but not used. On\nthe right panel, the interruption stops the interpolation at the basis\nwith the highest index value for each iteration and results in a final\nbasis with a higher index value, as shown on the right panel.\n\n\n\nClose but not close enough\nOnce the final basis has been found by an optimiser, one may want to\npush further in the close neighbourhood to see if an even better basis\ncan be found. A polish search takes the final basis of an optimiser as\nthe start of a new guided tour to search for local improvements. The\npolish algorithm is similar to the CRS but with three distinctions: 1) a\nhundred rather than one candidate bases are generated each time in the\ninner loop; 2) the neighbourhood size is reduced in the inner loop,\nrather than in the outer loop; and 3) three more termination conditions\nhave been added to ensure the new basis generated is distinguishable\nfrom the current one in terms of the distance in the space, the relative\nchange in the index value, and neighbourhood size:\nthe distance between the basis found and the current needs to be\nlarger than 1e-3;\nthe relative change of the index value needs to be larger than 1e-5;\nand\nthe alpha parameter needs to be larger than 0.01.\nFigure 9 presents the projected data and trace plot of\na 2D projection, optimised by CRS and followed by the polish step. The\ntop row shows the initial projection, the final projection after CRS,\nand the final projection after polish, respectively. The end basis found\nby CRS reveals the four clusters in the data, but the edges of each\ncluster are not clean-cut. Polish works with this end basis and further\npushes the index value to produce clearer edges of the cluster,\nespecially along the vertical axis.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of the projected data before and after using\npolishing for a 2D projection problem on data using holes index. The top\nrow shows the initial projected data and the final views after CRS and\npolish search, and the second row traces the index value. The clustering\nstructure in the data is detected by CRS (top middle panel), but the\npolish step improves the index value and produces clearer boundaries of\nthe clusters (top right panel), especially along the vertical axis. Note\nthat the parameter is set to 400 in this experiment for CRS to do its\nbest.\n\n\n\nSeeing the signal in the\nnoise\nThe holes index function used for all the examples before this\nsection produces a smooth interpolation, while this is not the case for\nall the indexes. An example of a noisy index function for 1D projections\ncompares the projected data, \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{n\n\\times 1}\\), to a randomly generated normal distribution, \\(\\mathcal{N}_{n \\times 1}\\), using the\nKolmogorov test. Let \\(F_{.}(n)\\) be\nthe empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) with two possible\nsubscripts, \\(Y\\) and \\(\\mathcal{N}\\), representing the projected\nand randomly generated data, and \\(n\\)\ndenoting the number of observations, the Kolmogorov index \\(I^{nk}(n)\\), is defined as:\n\\[I^{K}(n) = \\max \\left[F_{Y}(n) -\nF_{\\mathcal{N}}(n)\\right].\\] With a non-smooth index function,\ntwo research questions are raised:\nwhether any optimiser fails to optimise this non-smooth index;\nand\nwhether the optimisers can find the global optimum despite the\npresence of a local optimum.\nFigure 10 presents the trace and PCA plots of\nall three optimisers, and as expected, none of the interpolated paths\nare smooth. There is barely any improvement made by PD, indicating its\nfailure in optimising non-smooth index functions. While CRS and SA have\nmanaged to get close to the index value of the theoretical best, the\ntrace plot shows that it takes SA much longer to find the final basis.\nThis long interpolation path is partially due to the fluctuation in the\nearly iterations, where SA tends to generously accept inferior bases\nbefore concentrating near the optimum. The PCA plot shows the\ninterpolation path and search points, excluding the last termination\niteration. Pseudo-Derivative (PD) quickly gets stuck near the starting\nposition. Comparing the amount of random search done by CRS and SA, it\nis surprising that SA does not carry as many samples as CRS. Combining\nthe insights from both the trace and PCA plot, one can learn the two\ndifferent search strategies by CRS and SA: CRS frequently samples in the\nspace and only make a move when an improvement is guaranteed to be made,\nwhile SA first broadly accepts bases in the space and then starts the\nextensive sampling in a narrowed subspace. The specific decision of\nwhich optimiser to use will depend on the index curve in the basis\nspace, but if the basis space is non-smooth, accepting inferior bases at\nfirst, as SA has done here, can lead to a more efficient search in terms\nof the overall number of points evaluated.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of the three optimisers in optimising\n\\(I^{nk}(n)\\) index for a 1D projection\nproblem on a five-variable dataset, . Both CRS and SA succeed in the\noptimisation, PD fails to optimise this non-smooth index. Further, SA\ntakes much longer than CRS to finish the optimisation, but finishes off\ncloser to the theoretical best.\n\n\n\nThe next experiment compares the performance of CRS and SA when a\nlocal maximum exists. Two search neighbourhood sizes, 0.5 and 0.7, are\ncompared to understand how a large search neighbourhood would affect the\nfinal basis and the length of the search. Figure 11\nshows 80 paths simulated using 20 seeds in the PCA plot, faceted by the\noptimiser and search size. With CRS and a search size of 0.5, despite\nbeing the simplest and fastest, the optimiser fails in three instances\nwhere the final basis lands neither near the local nor the global\noptimum. With a larger search size of 0.7, more seeds have found the\nglobal maximum. Comparing CRS and SA for a search size of 0.5, SA does\nnot seem to improve the final basis found, despite having longer\ninterpolation paths. However, the denser paths near the local maximum\nare an indicator that SA is working hard to examine if there is any\nother optimum in the basis space, but the relatively small search size\nhas diminished its ability to reach the global maximum. With a larger\nsearch size, almost all the seeds (16 out of 20) have found the global\nmaximum, and some final bases are much closer to the theoretical best,\nas compared to the three other cases. This indicates that SA, with a\nreasonable large search window, is able to overcome the local optimum\nand optimise close towards the global optimum.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Comparing 20 search paths in the PCA-projected basis\nspace faceted by two optimisers: CRS and SA, and two search sizes: 0.5\nand 0.7. The optimisation is on the 1D projection index, \\(I^{nk}(n)\\), for data, where a local\noptimum, annotated by the cross (x), is presented in this experiment,\nalong with the global optimum (*).\n\n\n\nReconciling the orientation\nOne interesting situation observed in the previous examples is that,\nfor some simulations, as shown on the left panel of Figure\n12, the target basis is generated on the other half of\nthe basis space, and the interpolator seems to draw a straight line to\ninterpolate. Bases with opposite signs do not affect the projection and\nindex value, but we would prefer the target to have the same orientation\nas the current basis. The orientation of two bases can be\ncomputationally checked by calculating the determinant – a negative\nvalue suggests the two bases have a different orientation. For 1D bases,\nthis can be corrected by flipping the sign on one basis. For higher\ndimensions, it can be a bit more difficult because the orthonormality of\nthe basis needs to be also maintained when an individual vector is\nflipped. Here, an orientation check is carried out once a new target\nbasis is generated, and the sign in the target basis will be flipped if\na negative determinant is obtained. The interpolation after implementing\nthe orientation check is shown on the right panel of Figure\n12, where the unsatisfactory interpolation no longer\nexists.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Comparison of the interpolation in the PCA-projected\nbasis space before and after reconciling the orientation of the target\nbasis. Optimisation is on the 1D projection index, \\(I^{nk}(n)\\), for boa6 data using CRS with\nseed 2463. The dots represent the target basis in each iteration, and\nthe path shows the interpolation. On the left panel, one target basis is\ngenerated with an opposite orientation to the current basis (hence\nappear on the other side of the basis space), and the interpolator\ncrosses the origin to perform the interpolation. The right panel shows\nthe same interpolation after implementing an orientation check, and the\nundesirable interpolation disappears.\n\n\n\nImplementation\nThis project contributes to the software development in two packages:\na data collection object is implemented in tourr (Wickham et al. 2011), while the visual\ndiagnostics of the optimisers is implemented in ferrn\n(Zhang et al. 2021). The functions in the\nferrn (Zhang et al. 2021)\npackage are listed below:\nMain plotting functions:\nexplore_trace_search() produces summary plots in Figure\n2.\nexplore_trace_interp() produces trace plots for the\ninterpolation points in Figure 3.\nexplore_space_pca() produces the PCA plot of projection\nbases on the reduced space. Figure 4 includes the\nadditional details of anchor and search bases, which can be turned on by\nthe argument details = TRUE. The animated version in Figure\n5 is produced with argument\nanimate = TRUE.\nexplore_space_tour() produces animated tour view on the\nfull space of the projection bases in Figure\n6.\n\nget_*() extracts and manipulates certain components\nfrom the existing data object.\nget_anchor() extracts target observations.\nget_basis_matrix() flattens all the bases into a\nmatrix.\nget_best() extracts the observation with the highest\nindex value in the data object.\nget_dir_search() extracts directional search\nobservations for PD search.\nget_interp() extracts interpolated observations.\nget_interp_last() extracts the ending interpolated\nobservations in each iteration.\nget_interrupt() extracts the ending interpolated\nobservations and the target observations if the interpolation is\n.interrupted\nget_search() extracts search observations.\nget_search_count() extracts the count of search\nobservations.\nget_space_param() produces the coordinates of the\ncentre and radius of the basis space.\nget_start() extracts the starting observation.\nget_theo() extracts the theoretical best observations,\nif given.\n\nbind_*() incorporates additional information outside\nthe tour optimisation into the data object.\nbind_theoretical() binds the theoretical best\nobservation in simulated experiment.\nbind_random() binds randomly generated bases in the\nprojection bases space to the data object.\nbind_random_matrix() binds randomly generated bases and\noutputs in a matrix format.\n\nadd_*() provides wrapper functions to create\nggprotos for different components for the PCA plot\nadd_anchor() for plotting anchor bases.\nadd_anno() for annotating the symmetry of start\nbases.\nadd_dir_search() for plotting the directional search\nbases with magnified distance.\nadd_end() for plotting end bases.\nadd_interp() for plotting the interpolation path.\nadd_interp_last() for plotting the last interpolation\nbases for comparing with target bases when interruption is used.\nadd_interrupt() for linking the last interpolation\nbases with target ones when interruption is used.\nadd_search() for plotting search bases.\nadd_space() for plotting the circular space.\nadd_start() for plotting start bases.\nadd_theo() for plotting theoretical best bases, if\napplicable.\n\nUtilities\ntheme_fern() and format_label() for better\ndisplay of the grid lines and axis formatting.\nclean_method() to clean up the name of the\noptimisers.\nbotanical_palettes() is a collection of colour palettes\nfrom Australian native plants. Quantitative palettes include daisy,\nbanksia, and cherry, and sequential palettes contain fern and\nacacia.\nbotanical_pal() as the colour interpolator.\nscale_color_*() and scale_fill_*() for\nscaling the colour and fill of the plot.\n\nConclusion\nThis paper has provided several visual diagnostics that can be used\nfor understanding a complex optimisation procedure and are implemented\nin the ferrn package. The methods were illustrated\nusing the optimisers available for projection pursuit guided tour. Here\nthe constraint is the orthonormality condition of the projection bases,\nwhich corresponds to optimisation over spheres and torii. The approach\ndescribed broadly applies to other constrained optimisers. Although the\nmanifold in \\(p\\)-space might be\ndifferent the diagnostic techniques are the same. A researcher would\nbegin by saving the path of the optimiser in a form required to input\ninto the ferrn package, as described in this paper. One might generally\nmake more samples from the constrained space upon which to assess and\ncompare the optimisation paths. These high-dimensional data objects can\nthen be viewed using the tour.\nThe progressive optimisation of a target function and its coverage of\nthe search space can be viewed in both reduced 2D space and the full\nspace. These visualisations can lead to insights for evaluating and\ncomparing the performance of multiple optimisers operating on the same\ntask. They can provide a better understanding of existing methods or\nmotivate the development of new approaches. For example, we have\ncompared how three optimisers perform when maximising a non-smooth index\nfunction and have illustrated how the pseudo-derivative search fails in\nthis setting. The observations from our experiments have also been\ntranslated into improved optimisation methods for the guided tour, e.g.,\nwe introduced the option to interrupt the search if a better basis is\nfound along the path.\nThis work might be considered an effort to bring transparency into\nalgorithms. Although little attention is paid by algorithm developers to\nproviding ways to output information during intermediate steps, this is\nan important component for enabling others to understand and diagnose\nthe performance. Algorithms are an essential component of artificial\nintelligence that is used to make daily life easier. Interpretability of\nalgorithms is important to guard against aspects like bias and\ninappropriate use. The data object underlying the visual diagnostics\nhere is an example of what might be useful in algorithm development\ngenerally.\nAcknowledgements\nThis article is created using knitr (Xie 2015) and rmarkdown (Xie et al. 2018) in R.

    "description": "Randomized response (RR) designs are used to collect response data about sensitive behaviors (e.g., criminal behavior, sexual desires). The modeling of RR data is more complex since it requires a description of the RR process. For the class of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), the RR process can be represented by an adjusted link function, which relates the expected RR to the linear predictor for most common RR designs. The package GLMMRR includes modified link functions for four different cumulative distributions (i.e., logistic, cumulative normal, Gumbel, Cauchy) for GLMs and GLMMs, where the package lme4 facilitates ML and REML estimation. The mixed modeling framework in GLMMRR can be used to jointly analyze data collected under different designs (e.g., dual questioning, multilevel, mixed mode, repeated measurements designs, multiple-group designs). Model-fit tests, tools for residual analyses, and plot functions to give support to a profound RR data analysis are added to the well-known features of the GLM and GLMM software (package lme4). Data of Höglinger and Jann (2018) and Höglinger, Jann, and Diekmann (2014) are used to illustrate the methodology and software.",

    "description": "Aviation data has become increasingly more accessible to the public thanks to the adoption of technologies such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and Mode S, which provide aircraft information over publicly accessible radio channels. Furthermore, the OpenSky Network provides multiple public resources to access such air traffic data from a large network of ADS-B receivers. Here, we present openSkies, the first R package for processing public air traffic data. The package provides an interface to the OpenSky Network resources, standardized data structures to represent the different entities involved in air traffic data, and functionalities to analyze and visualize such data. Furthermore, the portability of the implemented data structures makes openSkies easily reusable by other packages, therefore laying the foundation of aviation data engineering in R.",

    "description": "We present an R package bssm for Bayesian non-linear/non-Gaussian state space modeling. Unlike the existing packages, bssm allows for easy-to-use approximate inference based on Gaussian approximations such as the Laplace approximation and the extended Kalman filter. The package also accommodates discretely observed latent diffusion processes. The inference is based on fully automatic, adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) on the hyperparameters, with optional importance sampling post-correction to eliminate any approximation bias. The package also implements a direct pseudo-marginal MCMC and a delayed acceptance pseudo-marginal MCMC using intermediate approximations. The package offers an easy-to-use interface to define models with linear-Gaussian state dynamics with non-Gaussian observation models and has an Rcpp interface for specifying custom non-linear and diffusion models.",

    "description": "The CompModels package for R provides a suite of computer model test functions that can be used for computer model prediction/emulation, uncertainty quantification, and calibration. Moreover, the CompModels package is especially well suited for the sequential optimization of computer models. The package is a mix of real-world physics problems, known mathematical functions, and black-box functions that have been converted into computer models with the goal of Bayesian (i.e., sequential) optimization in mind. Likewise, the package contains computer models that represent either the constrained or unconstrained optimization case, each with varying levels of difficulty. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the package with both real-world examples and black-box functions by solving constrained optimization problems via Bayesian optimization. Ultimately, the package is shown to provide users with a source of computer model test functions that are reproducible, shareable, and that can be used for benchmarking of novel optimization methods.",

    "description": "Convenient and easy-to-use programs are readily available in R to simulate data from and probability calculations for several common multivariate distributions such as normal and t. However, functions for doing so from other less common multivariate distributions, especially those which are asymmetric, are not as readily available, either in R or otherwise. We introduce the R package NonNorMvtDist to generate random numbers from multivariate Lomax distribution, which constitutes a very flexible family of skewed multivariate distributions. Further, by applying certain useful properties of multivariate Lomax distribution, multivariate cases of generalized Lomax, Mardia’s Pareto of Type I, Logistic, Burr, Cook-Johnson’s uniform, F, and inverted beta can be also considered, and random numbers from these distributions can be generated. Methods for the probability and the equicoordinate quantile calculations for all these distributions are then provided. This work substantially enriches the existing R toolbox for nonnormal or nonsymmetric multivariate probability distributions.",

This method is an extension of the classical Kernel Density Estimate (KDE), a non parametric approach to estimate the intensity of a spatial process. More specifically, it adapts the KDE for cases when the study area is a network, constraining the location of events (such as accidents on roads, leaks in pipes, fish in rivers, etc.). We present and discuss in this paper the three main versions of NKDE: simple, discontinuous, and continuous that are implemented in spNetwork. We illustrate how to apply the three methods and map their results using a sample from a real dataset representing bike accidents in a central neighborhood of Montreal. We also describe the optimization techniques used to reduce calculation time and investigate their impacts when applying the three NKDE to a city-wide dataset.",

It combines judiciously selected eigenvectors from a transformed connectivity matrix to construct a synthetic spatial filter and remove spatial patterns from model residuals. This article introduces the spfilteR package that provides several useful and flexible tools to estimate spatially filtered linear and generalized linear models in R. While the package features functions to identify relevant eigenvectors based on different selection criteria in an unsupervised fashion, it also helps users to perform supervised spatial filtering and to select eigenvectors based on alternative user-defined criteria. Besides a brief discussion of the eigenvector-based spatial filtering approach, this article presents the main functions of the package and illustrates their usage. Comparison to alternative implementations in other R packages highlights the added value of the spfilteR package.",

    "description": "Marginal methods have been widely used for analyzing longitudinal ordinal data due to their simplicity in model assumptions, robustness in inference results, and easiness in the implementation. However, they are often inapplicable in the presence of measurement errors in the variables. Under the setup of longitudinal studies with ordinal responses and covariates subject to misclassification, Chen et al. (2014) developed marginal methods for misclassification adjustments using the second-order estimating equations and proposed a two-stage estimation approach when the validation subsample is available. Parameter estimation is conducted through the Newton-Raphson algorithm, and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators is established. While the methods of Chen et al. (2014) can successfully correct the misclassification effects, its implementation is not accessible to general users due to the lack of a software package. In this paper, we develop an R package, mgee2, to implement the marginal methods proposed by Chen et al. (2014). To evaluate the performance and illustrate the features of the package, we conduct numerical studies.",

Leveraging this functionality, the MoTBFs package supports learning of MoTBF-based Bayesian networks over hybrid domains. We give a brief introduction to the methodological context and algorithms implemented in the package. An extensive illustrative example is used to describe the package, its functionality, and its usage.",

    "title": "Analyzing Basket Trials under Multisource Exchangeability Assumptions",
    "description": "Basket designs are prospective clinical trials that are devised with the hypothesis that the presence of selected molecular features determine a patient’s subsequent response to a particular “targeted” treatment strategy. Basket trials are designed to enroll multiple clinical subpopulations to which it is assumed that the therapy in question offers beneficial efficacy in the presence of the targeted molecular profile. The treatment, however, may not offer acceptable efficacy to all subpopulations enrolled. Moreover, for rare disease settings, such as oncology wherein these trials have become popular, marginal measures of statistical evidence are difficult to interpret for sparsely enrolled subpopulations. Consequently, basket trials pose challenges to the traditional paradigm for trial design, which assumes inter-patient exchangeability. The package basket for the R programmming environment (R Core Team, 2019) facilitates the analysis of basket trials by implementing multi source exchangeability models. By evaluating all possible pairwise exchangeability relationships, this hierarchical modeling framework facilitates Bayesian posterior shrinkage among a collection of discrete and pre-specified subpopulations. Analysis functions are provided to implement posterior inference of the response rates and all possible exchangeability relationships between subpopulations. In addition, the package can identify “poolable” subsets of and report their response characteristics. The functionality of the package is demonstrated using data from an oncology study with subpopulations defined by tumor histology.

    "description": "We provide a publicly available library FarmTest in the R programming system. This library implements a factor-adjusted robust multiple testing principle proposed by Fan et al. (2019) for large-scale simultaneous inference on mean effects. We use a multi-factor model to explicitly capture the dependence among a large pool of variables. Three types of factors are considered: observable, latent, and a mixture of observable and latent factors. The non-factor case, which corresponds to standard multiple mean testing under weak dependence, is also included. The library implements a series of adaptive Huber methods integrated with fast data-driven tuning schemes to estimate model parameters and to construct test statistics that are robust against heavy-tailed and asymmetric error distributions. Extensions to two-sample multiple mean testing problems are also discussed. The results of some simulation experiments and a real data analysis are reported.",

    "description": "Penalized regression models such as the lasso have been extensively applied to analyzing high-dimensional data sets. However, due to memory limitations, existing R packages like glmnet and ncvreg are not capable of fitting lasso-type models for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that are increasingly seen in many areas such as genetics, genomics, biomedical imaging, and high-frequency finance. In this research, we implement an R package called biglasso that tackles this challenge. biglasso utilizes memory-mapped files to store the massive data on the disk, only reading data into memory when necessary during model fitting, and is thus able to handle out-of core computation seamlessly. Moreover, it’s equipped with newly proposed, more efficient feature screening rules, which substantially accelerate the computation. Benchmarking experiments show that our biglasso package, as compared to existing popular ones like glmnet, is much more memory and computation-efficient. We further analyze a 36 GB simulated GWAS data set on a laptop with only 16 GB RAM to demonstrate the out-of-core computation capability of biglasso in analyzing massive data sets that cannot be accommodated by existing R packages.",

However, when the hazard functions cross, tests in existing R packages do not perform well. To address the issue, we introduce the package survELtest, which provides tests for comparing multiple survival functions with possibly crossing hazards. Due to its powerful likelihood ratio formulation, this is the only R package to date that works when the hazard functions cross. We illustrate the use of the procedures in survELtest by applying them to data from randomized clinical trials and simulated datasets. We show that these methods lead to more significant results than those obtained by existing R packages.",

The time required to construct a pharmacometrics dataset can sometimes be higher than the effort required for the modeling per se. To simplify the process, the puzzle R package has been developed aimed at simplifying and facilitating the time consuming and error prone task of assembling pharmacometrics datasets. Puzzle consist of a series of functions written in R. These functions create, from tabulated files, datasets that are compatible with the formatting requirements of the gold standard non-linear mixed effects modeling software. With only one function, puzzle(), complex pharmacometrics databases can easily be assembled. Users are able to select from different absorption processes such as zeroand first-order, or a com bination of both. Furthermore, datasets containing data from one or more analytes, and/or one or more responses, and/or time dependent and/or independent covariates, and/or urine data can be simultaneously assembled. The puzzle package is a powerful and efficient tool that helps modelers, programmers and pharmacometricians through the challenging process of assembling pharmacometrics datasets.",

While it is demonstrated that the complexity of Shiny applications is limited by the background architecture, and real security concerns exist for novice app developers, the collaborative benefits are worth attention from the wider research community. Shiny simplifies the use of complex methodologies for people of different specialities, at the level of proficiency appropriate for the end user. This enables a diverse community of users to interact efficiently, and utilise cutting edge methodologies. The literature reviewed demonstrates that complex methodologies can be put into practice without insisting on investment in professional training, for a comprehensive understanding from all participants. It appears that Shiny opens up concurrent benefits in communication between those who analyse data and other disciplines, that would enrich much of the peer-reviewed research.",

    "description": "Advancements in medical informatics tools and high-throughput biological experimentation make large-scale biomedical data routinely accessible to researchers. Competing risks data are typical in biomedical studies where individuals are at risk to more than one cause (type of event) which can preclude the others from happening. The Fine and Gray (1999) proportional subdistribution hazards model is a popular and well-appreciated model for competing risks data and is currently implemented in a number of statistical software packages. However, current implementations are not computation ally scalable for large-scale competing risks data. We have developed an R package, fastcmprsk, that uses a novel forward-backward scan algorithm to significantly reduce the computational complexity for parameter estimation by exploiting the structure of the subject-specific risk sets. Numerical studies compare the speed and scalability of our implementation to current methods for unpenalized and penalized Fine-Gray regression and show impressive gains in computational efficiency.",

    "title": "ordinalClust: An R Package to Analyze Ordinal Data",
    "description": "Ordinal data are used in many domains, especially when measurements are collected from people through observations, tests, or questionnaires. ordinalClust is an innovative R package dedicated to ordinal data that provides tools for modeling, clustering, co-clustering and classifying such data. Ordinal data are modeled using the BOS distribution, which is a model with two meaningful parameters referred to as \"position\" and \"precision\". The former indicates the mode of the distribution and the latter describes how scattered the data are around the mode: the user is able to easily interpret the distribution of their data when given these two parameters. The package is based on the co clustering framework (when rows and columns are simultaneously clustered). The co-clustering approach uses the Latent Block Model (LBM) and the SEM-Gibbs algorithm for parameter inference. On the other hand, the clustering and the classification methods follow on from simplified versions of the SEM-Gibbs algorithm. For the classification process, two approaches are proposed. In the first one, the BOS parameters are estimated from the training dataset in the conventional way. In the second approach, parsimony is introduced by estimating the parameters and column-clusters from the training dataset. We empirically show that this approach can yield better results. For the clustering and co-clustering processes, the ICL-BIC criterion is used for model selection purposes. An overview of these methods is given, and the way to use them with the ordinalClust package is described using real datasets. The latest stable package version is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

    "description": "Kernel semi-parametric models and their equivalence with linear mixed models provide analysts with the flexibility of machine learning methods and a foundation for inference and tests of hypothesis. These models are not impacted by the number of predictor variables, since the kernel trick transforms them to a kernel matrix whose size only depends on the number of subjects. Hence, methods based on this model are appealing and numerous, however only a few R programs are available and none includes a complete set of features. Here, we present the KSPM package to fit the kernel semi-parametric model and its extensions in a unified framework. KSPM allows multiple kernels and unlimited interactions in the same model. It also includes predictions, statistical tests, variable selection procedure and graphical tools for diagnostics and interpretation of variable effects. Currently KSPM is implemented for continuous dependent variables but could be extended to binary or survival outcomes.",

    "description": "The demand for precise data for analytical purposes grows rapidly among the research community and decision makers as more geographic information is being collected. Laws protecting data privacy are being enforced to prevent data disclosure. Statistical institutes and agencies need methods to preserve confidentiality while maintaining accuracy when disclosing geographic data. In this paper we present the AQuadtree package, a software intended to produce and deal with official spatial data making data privacy and accuracy compatible. The lack of specific methods in R to anonymize spatial data motivated the development of this package, providing an automatic aggregation tool to anonymize point data. We propose a methodology based on hierarchical geographic data structures to create a varying size grid adapted to local area population densities. This article gives insights and hints for implementation and usage. We hope this new tool may be helpful for statistical offices and users of official spatial data.",

The data analyzed is a set/mixture of continuous and correlated components/chemicals that are reasonable to combine in an index and share a common outcome. These components are also interval-censored between zero and upper thresholds, or detection limits, which may differ among the components. This type of data is found in areas such as chemical epidemiological studies, sociology, and genomics. The miWQS package can be run using complete or incomplete data, which may be placed in the first quantile, or imputed using bootstrap or Bayesian approach.

    "title": "User-Specified General-to-Specific and Indicator Saturation Methods",
    "description": "General-to-Specific (GETS) modelling provides a comprehensive, systematic and cumulative approach to modelling that is ideally suited for conditional forecasting and counterfactual analysis, whereas Indicator Saturation (ISAT) is a powerful and flexible approach to the detection and estimation of structural breaks (e.g. changes in parameters), and to the detection of outliers. To these ends, multi path backwards elimination, single and multiple hypothesis tests on the coefficients, diagnostics tests and goodness-of-fit measures are combined to produce a parsimonious final model. In many situations a specific model or estimator is needed, a specific set of diagnostics tests may be required, or a specific fit criterion is preferred. In these situations, if the combination of estimator/model, diagnostics tests and fit criterion is not offered in a pre-programmed way by publicly available software, then the implementation of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods puts a large programming-burden on the user. Generic functions and procedures that facilitate the implementation of user-specified GETS and ISAT methods for specific problems can therefore be of great benefit. The R package gets is the first software – both inside and outside the R universe – to provide a complete set of facilities for user-specified GETS and ISAT methods: User-specified model/estimator, user-specified diagnostics and user-specified goodness-of-fit criteria. The aim of this article is to illustrate how user-specified GETS and ISAT methods can be implemented with the R package gets.",

    "description": "One of the most common applications of spatial data analysis is detecting zones, at a certain scale, where a point-referenced event under study is especially concentrated. The detection of such zones, which are usually referred to as hotspots, is essential in certain fields such as criminology, epidemiology, or traffic safety. Traditionally, hotspot detection procedures have been developed over areal units of analysis. Although working at this spatial scale can be suitable enough for many research or practical purposes, detecting hotspots at a more accurate level (for instance, at the road segment level) may be more convenient sometimes. Furthermore, it is typical that hotspot detection procedures are entirely focused on the determination of zones where an event is (overall) highly concentrated. It is less common, by far, that such procedures focus on detecting zones where a specific type of event is overrepresented in comparison with the other types observed, which have been denoted as differential risk hotspots. The R package DRHotNet provides several functionalities to facilitate the detection of differential risk hotspots within a linear network. In this paper, DRHotNet is depicted, and its usage in the R console is shown through a detailed analysis of a crime dataset.",

    "description": "Left censoring can occur with relative frequency when analyzing recurrent events in epi demiological studies, especially observational ones. Concretely, the inclusion of individuals that were already at risk before the effective initiation in a cohort study may cause the unawareness of prior episodes that have already been experienced, and this will easily lead to biased and inefficient estimates. The miRecSurv package is based on the use of models with specific baseline hazard, with multiple imputation of the number of prior episodes when unknown by means of the COMPoisson distribution, a very flexible count distribution that can handle over, sub, and equidispersion, with a stratified model depending on whether the individual had or had not previously been at risk, and the use of a frailty term. The usage of the package is illustrated by means of a real data example based on an occupational cohort study and a simulation study.",

    "description": "Balancing the distributions of the confounders across the exposure levels in an observational study through matching or weighting is an accepted method to control for confounding due to these variables when estimating the association between an exposure and outcome and reducing the degree of dependence on certain modeling assumptions. Despite the increasing popularity in practice, these procedures cannot be immediately applied to datasets with missing values. Multiple imputation of the missing data is a popular approach to account for missing values while preserving the number of units in the dataset and accounting for the uncertainty in the missing values. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive matching and weighting software that can be easily implemented with multiply imputed datasets. In this paper, we review this problem and suggest a framework to map out the matching and weighting of multiply imputed datasets to 5 actions as well as the best practices to assess balance in these datasets after matching and weighting. We also illustrate these approaches using a companion package for R, MatchThem.",

By relying on a Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm (MLA), a Newton-like method particularly robust for solving local optimization problems, we provide with marqLevAlg package an efficient and general-purpose local optimizer which (i) prevents con vergence to saddle points by using a stringent convergence criterion based on the relative distance to minimum/maximum in addition to the stability of the parameters and of the objective function; and (ii) reduces the computation time in complex settings by allowing parallel calculations at each iteration. We demonstrate through a variety of cases from the literature that our implementation reli ably and consistently reaches the optimum (even when other optimizers fail) and also largely reduces computational time in complex settings through the example of maximum likelihood estimation of different sophisticated statistical models.",

    "description": "When investigators observe non-random samples from populations, sample selectivity problems may occur. The Heckman selection model is widely used to deal with selectivity problems. Based on the EM algorithm, Zhao et al. (2020) developed three algorithms, namely, ECM, ECM(NR), and ECME(NR), which also have the EM algorithm’s main advantages: stability and ease of imple mentation. This paper provides the implementation of these three new EM-type algorithms in the package EMSS and illustrates the usage of the package on several simulated and real data examples. The comparison between the maximum likelihood estimation method (MLE) and three new EM-type algorithms in robustness issues is further discussed.",

    "description": "In ophthalmology, the early detection of keratoconus is still a crucial problem. Placido disk corneal topographers are essential in clinical practice, and many indices for diagnosing corneal irregularities exist. The main goal of this work is to present the R package rPACI, providing several functions to handle and analyze corneal data. This package implements primary indices of corneal irregularity (based on geometrical properties) and compound indices built from the primary ones, either using a generalized linear model or as a Bayesian classifier using a hybrid Bayesian network and performing approximate inference. rPACI aims to make the analysis of corneal data accessible for practitioners and researchers in the field. Moreover, a shiny app was developed to use rPACI in any web browser in a truly user-friendly graphical interface without installing R or writing any R code. It is openly deployed at https://admaldonado.shinyapps.io/rPACI/.",

However, if the variables of interest are ordered categorical data, the development of statistical methods and software for assessing their partial association is limited. Following the framework established by Liu et al. (2021), we develop an R package PAsso for assessing Partial Associations between ordinal variables. The package provides various functions that allow users to perform a wide spectrum of assessments, including quantification, visualization, and hypothesis testing. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of PAsso in detail and demonstrate its utility through an analysis of the 2016 American National Election Study.",

    "description": "Multidimensional scaling (MDS), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and discriminant analysis (DA) are classical techniques which deal with data made of n individuals and p variables. When the individuals are divided into T groups, the R package dad associates with each group a multivariate probability density function and then carries out these techniques on the densities, which are estimated by the data under consideration. These techniques are based on distance measures between densities: chi-square, Hellinger, Jeffreys, Jensen-Shannon, and L p for discrete densities, Hellinger , Jeffreys, L2 , and 2-Wasserstein for Gaussian densities, and L2 for numeric non-Gaussian densities estimated by the Gaussian kernel method. Practical methods help the user to give meaning to the outputs in the context of MDS and HCA and to look for an optimal prediction in the context of DA based on the one-leave-out misclassification ratio. Some functions for data management or basic statistics calculations on groups are annexed.",

    "description": "Dynamic low-dimensional linear projections of multivariate data collectively known as tours provide an important tool for exploring multivariate data and models. The R package tourr provides functions for several types of tours: grand, guided, little, local and frozen. Each of these can be viewed dynamically, or saved into a data object for animation. This paper describes a new package, spinifex, which provides a manual tour of multivariate data where the projection coefficient of a single variable is controlled. The variable is rotated fully into the projection, or completely out of the projection. The resulting sequence of projections can be displayed as an animation, with functions from either the plotly or gganimate packages. By varying the coefficient of a single variable, it is possible to explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to that variable. This is particularly useful when used with a projection pursuit guided tour to simplify and understand the solution. The use of the manual tour is applied particle physics data to illustrate the sensitivity of structure in a projection to specific variable contributions.",

These distributions have the unusual property that they are defined through their quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function) and their density is unavailable in closed form, which makes parameter inference complicated. This paper presents the gk R package to work with these distributions. It provides the usual distribution functions and several algorithms for inference of independent identically distributed data, including the finite difference stochastic approximation method, which has not been used before for this problem.",

In this article, we present a theoretical description of methods from the NlinTS package, and we focus on causality measures. The package contains the classical Granger causality test. To handle non-linear time series, we propose an extension of this test using an artificial neural network. The package includes an implementation of the Transfer entropy, which is also considered as a non linear causality measure based on information theory. For discrete variables, we use the classical Shannon Transfer entropy, while for continuous variables, we adopt the k-nearest neighbors approach to estimate it.",

    "description": "High-dimensional variable selection in the proportional hazards (PH) model has many successful applications in different areas. In practice, data may involve confounding variables that do not satisfy the PH assumption, in which case the stratified proportional hazards (SPH) model can be adopted to control the confounding effects by stratification without directly modeling the confounding effects. However, there is a lack of computationally efficient statistical software for high-dimensional variable selection in the SPH model. In this work an R package, SurvBoost, is developed to implement the gradient boosting algorithm for fitting the SPH model with high-dimensional covariate variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that in many scenarios SurvBoost can achieve better selection accuracy and reduce computational time substantially compared to the existing R package that implements boosting algorithms without stratification. The proposed R package is also illustrated by an analysis of gene expression data with survival outcome in The Cancer Genome Atlas study. In addition, a detailed hands-on tutorial for SurvBoost is provided.",

One difficulty with this skew-t family is that the elements of the expected information matrix do not have closed form analytic formulas. Thus, we developed a numerical integration method of computing the expected information matrix in the R package skewtInfo. The accuracy of our expected information matrix calculation method was confirmed by comparing the result with that obtained using an observed information matrix for a very large sample size. A Monte Carlo study to evaluate the accuracy of the standard errors obtained with our expected information matrix calculation method, for the case of three realistic skew-t parameter vectors, indicates that use of the expected information matrix results in standard errors as accurate as, and sometimes a little more accurate than, use of an observed information matrix.",

    "title": "Tools for Analyzing R Code the Tidy Way",
    "description": "With the current emphasis on reproducibility and replicability, there is an increasing need to examine how data analyses are conducted. In order to analyze the between researcher variability in data analysis choices as well as the aspects within the data analysis pipeline that contribute to the variability in results, we have created two R packages: matahari and tidycode. These packages build on methods created for natural language processing; rather than allowing for the processing of natural language, we focus on R code as the substrate of interest. The matahari package facilitates the logging of everything that is typed in the R console or in an R script in a tidy data frame. The tidycode package contains tools to allow for analyzing R calls in a tidy manner. We demonstrate the utility of these packages as well as walk through two examples.",

    "description": "Bivariate time-to-event data frequently arise in research areas such as clinical trials and epidemiological studies, where the occurrence of two events are correlated. In many cases, the exact event times are unknown due to censoring. The copula model is a popular approach for modeling correlated bivariate censored data, in which the two marginal distributions and the between margin dependence are modeled separately. This article presents the R package CopulaCenR, which is designed for modeling and testing bivariate data under right or (general) interval censoring in a regression setting. It provides a variety of Archimedean copula functions including a flexible two-parameter copula and different types of regression models (parametric and semiparametric) for marginal distributions. In particular, it implements a semiparametric transformation model for the margins with proportional hazards and proportional odds models being its special cases. The numerical optimization is based on a novel two-step algorithm. For the regression parameters, three likelihood-based tests (Wald, generalized score and likelihood ratio tests) are also provided. We use two real data examples to illustrate the key functions in CopulaCenR.",

Various methods have been proposed to detect these issues. The difNLR R package extends DIF methods currently provided in other packages by offering approaches based on generalized logistic regression models that account for possible guessing or inattention, and by pro viding methods to detect DIF and DDF among ordinal and nominal data. In the current paper, we describe implementation of the main functions of the difNLR package, from data generation, through the model fitting and hypothesis testing, to graphical representation of the results. Finally, we provide a real data example to bring the concepts together.",

The model is grounded on the idea that the probability density of an observed ranking decreases exponentially with the distance to the location parameter. It is the first Bayesian implementation that allows wide choices of distances, and it works well with a large amount of items to be ranked. BayesMallows handles non-standard data: partial rankings and pairwise comparisons, even in cases including non-transitive preference patterns. The Bayesian paradigm allows coherent quantification of posterior uncertainties of estimates of any quantity of interest. These posteriors are fully available to the user, and the package comes with convienient tools for summarizing and visualizing the posterior distributions.",

    "description": "Third-party software for assuring source code quality is becoming increasingly popular. Tools that evaluate the coverage of unit tests, perform static code analysis, or inspect run-time memory use are crucial in the software development life cycle. More sophisticated methods allow for performing meta-analyses of large software repositories, e.g., to discover abstract topics they relate to or common design patterns applied by their developers. They may be useful in gaining a better understanding of the component interdependencies, avoiding cloned code as well as detecting plagiarism in programming classes. A meaningful measure of similarity of computer programs often forms the basis of such tools. While there are a few noteworthy instruments for similarity assessment, none of them turns out particularly suitable for analysing R code chunks. Existing solutions rely on rather simple techniques and heuristics and fail to provide a user with the kind of sensitivity and specificity required for working with R scripts. In order to fill this gap, we propose a new algorithm based on a Program Dependence Graph, implemented in the SimilaR package. It can serve as a tool not only for improving R code quality but also for detecting plagiarism, even when it has been masked by applying some obfuscation techniques or imputing dead code. We demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency in a real-world case study.",

It is a set of tools for simulation of these processes as well as performing statistical inference and simulation studies on them. We introduce: tools that we developed to work with that type of motions as well as methods and ideas underlying them. Also we perform numerical experiments to show finite-sample behavior of certain estimators of the integral, and give an idea of how to envelope workflow related to the linear fractional stable motion in S4 classes and methods.

Confidence intervals can also obtained for each method. Machine learning algorithms can be used for estimating the propensities or for predicting the unknown values of the target variable for the non-sampled units.

    "description": "This article illustrates the use of the bcmixed package and focuses on the two main functions: bcmarg and bcmmrm. The bcmarg function provides inference results for a marginal model of a mixed ef fect model using the Box–Cox transformation. The bcmmrm function provides model median inferences based on the mixed effect models for repeated measures analysis using the Box–Cox transformation for longitudinal randomized clinical trials. Using the bcmmrm function, analysis results with high power and high interpretability for treatment effects can be obtained for longitudinal randomized clinical trials with skewed outcomes. Further, the bcmixed package provides summarizing and visualization tools, which would be helpful to write clinical trial reports.",

    "description": "The number of packages/software for Gaussian State Space models has increased over recent decades. However, there are very few codes available for non-Gaussian State Space (NGSS) models due to analytical intractability that prevents exact calculations. One of the few tractable exceptions is the family of NGSS with exact marginal likelihood, named NGSSEML. In this work, we present the wide range of data formats and distributions handled by NGSSEML and a package in the R language to perform classical and Bayesian inference for them. Special functions for filtering, forecasting, and smoothing procedures and the exact calculation of the marginal likelihood function are provided. The methods implemented in the package are illustrated for count and volatility time series and some reliability/survival models, showing that the codes are easy to handle. Therefore, the NGSSEML family emerges as a simple and interesting option/alternative for modeling non-Gaussian time-varying structures commonly encountered in time series and reliability/survival studies.

However, exposure misclassification frequently appears in case–control studies due to inaccurate data reporting, which can produce bias in measures of association. In this article, we implement a Bayesian sensitivity analysis of misclassification to provide a full posterior inference on the corrected odds ratio under both non-differential and differen tial misclassification. We present an R (R Core Team, 2018) package BayesSenMC, which provides user-friendly functions for its implementation. The usage is illustrated by a real data analysis on the association between bipolar disorder and rheumatoid arthritis.",

Unlike existing packages, the cat.dt package represents the CAT in a Decision Tree (DT) structure. This allows building the test before its administration, ensuring that the creation time of the test is independent of the number of participants. Moreover, to accelerate the construction of the tree, the package controls its growth by joining nodes with similar estimations or distributions of the ability level and uses techniques such as message passing and pre-calculations. The constructed tree, as well as the estimation procedure, can be visualized using the graphical tools included in the package. An experiment designed to evaluate its performance shows that the cat.dt package drastically reduces computational time in the creation of CATs without compromising accuracy.",

    "description": "In many contexts, missing data and disclosure control are ubiquitous and challenging issues. In particular, at statistical agencies, the respondent-level data they collect from surveys and censuses can suffer from high rates of missingness. Furthermore, agencies are obliged to protect respondents’ privacy when publishing the collected data for public use. The NPBayesImputeCat R package, introduced in this paper, provides routines to i) create multiple imputations for missing data and ii) create synthetic data for statistical disclosure control, for multivariate categorical data, with or without structural zeros. We describe the Dirichlet process mixture of products of the multinomial distributions model used in the package and illustrate various uses of the package using data samples from the American Community Survey (ACS). We also compare results of the missing data imputation to the mice R package and those of the synthetic data generation to the synthpop R package.",

Estimation and mapping methods are implemented for continuous, discrete, and right-censored survival data.

Parametric models in this class use parametric functions to model the response process, which in practice can be restrictive. MUDFOLD (Multiple UniDimensional unFOLDing) can be used to obtain estimates of person and item ranks without imposing strict parametric assumptions on the item response functions (IRFs). This paper describes the implementation of the MUDFOLD method for binary preferential-choice data in the R package mudfold. The latter incorporates estimation, visualization, and simulation methods in order to provide R users with utilities for nonparametric analysis of attitudinal questionnaire data. After a brief introduction in IRT, we provide the method ological framework implemented in the package. A description of the available functions is followed by practical examples and suggestions on how this method can be used even outside the field of psychometrics.",

This article discusses the main methodological and numerical features of the R software package lspartition, which implements results for partitioning-based least squares (series) regression estimation and inference from Cattaneo and Farrell (2013) and Cattaneo, Farrell, and Feng (2020). These results cover the multivariate regression function as well as its derivatives. First, the package provides data-driven methods to choose the number of partition knots optimally, according to integrated mean squared error, yielding optimal point estimation. Second, robust bias correction is implemented to combine this point estimator with valid inference. Third, the package provides estimates and inference for the unknown function both pointwise and uniformly in the conditioning variables. In particular, valid confidence bands are provided. Finally, an extension to two-sample analysis is developed, which can be used in treatment-control comparisons and related problems.",

The illness-death model plays a central role in the theory and practice of these models, describing the dynamics of healthy subjects who may move to an intermediate \"diseased\" state before entering into a terminal absorbing state. In these models, one important goal is the modeling of transition rates which is usually done by studying the relationship between covariates and disease evolution. However, biomedical researchers are also interested in reporting other interpretable results in a simple and summarized manner. These include estimates of predictive probabilities, such as the transition probabilities, occupation probabilities, cumulative incidence functions, and the sojourn time distributions. The development of survidm package has been motivated by recent contribution that provides answers to all these topics. An illustration of the software usage is included using real data.",

    "description": "Researchers and data-analysts often use the linear regression model for descriptive, predictive, and inferential purposes. This model relies on a set of assumptions that, when not satisfied, yields biased results and noisy estimates. A common problem that can be solved in many ways – use of less restrictive methods (e.g. generalized linear regression models or non-parametric methods ), variance corrections or transformations of the response variable just to name a few. We focus on the latter option as it allows to keep using the simple and well-known linear regression model. The list of transformations proposed in the literature is long and varies according to the problem they aim to solve. Such diversity can leave analysts lost and confused. We provide a framework implemented as an R-package, trafo, to help select suitable transformations depending on the user requirements and data being analyzed. The package trafo contains a collection of selected transformations and estimation methods that complement and increase the breadth of methods that exist in R.",

    "description": "The purpose of this paper is to introduce the R package BondValuation for the analysis of large datasets of fixed coupon bonds. The conceptual heterogeneity of fixed coupon bonds traded in the global markets imposes a high degree of complexity on their comparative analysis. Contrary to baseline fixed income theory, in practice, most bonds feature coupon period irregularities. In addition, there are a multitude of day count methods that determine the interest accrual, the cash flows and the discount factors used in bond valuation. Several R packages, e.g., fBonds, RQuantLib, and YieldCurve, provide tools for fixed income analysis. Nevertheless, none of them is capable of evaluating bonds featuring irregular first and/or final coupon periods, and neither provides adequate coverage of day count conventions currently used in the global bond markets. The R package BondValuation closes this gap using the generalized valuation methodology presented in Djatschenko (2019).",

In addition, we consider a new complex-valued definition of the spatial ARCH process. Moreover, spatial GARCH models are briefly discussed. From a practical point of view, the use of the R-package spGARCH is demonstrated. To be precise, we show how the proposed spatial ARCH models can be simulated and summarize the variety of spatial models, which can be estimated by the estimation functions provided in the package. Eventually, we apply all procedures to a real-data example.",

The methods are unified by the approach of defining an optimal hyperplane to separate clusters, and deriving a projection index whose optimiser is the vector normal to this separating hyperplane. Divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms that can detect clusters defined in different subspaces are readily obtained by recursively bi-partitioning the data through such hyperplanes. Projecting onto the vector normal to the optimal hyperplane enables visualisations of the data that can be used to validate the partition at each level of the cluster hierarchy. Clustering models can also be modified in an interactive manner to improve their solutions. Extensions to problems involving clusters which are not linearly separable, and to the problem of finding maximum hard margin hyperplanes for clustering are also discussed.",

These classifiers are called associative classifiers and the best-known algorithm is Classification Based on Associations (CBA). Interestingly, only very few implementations are available and, until recently, no implementation was available for R. Now, three packages provide CBA. This paper introduces associative classification, the CBA algorithm, and how it can be used in R. A comparison of the three packages is provided to give the potential user an idea about the advantages of each of the implementations. We also show how the packages are related to the existing infrastructure for association rule mining already available in R.",

Because it is estimated using only the observed durations’ rank ordering, typical quantities of interest used to communicate results of the Cox model come from the hazard function (e.g., hazard ratios or percentage changes in the hazard rate). These quantities are substantively vague and difficult for many audiences of research to understand. We introduce a suite of methods in the R package coxed to address these problems. The package allows researchers to calculate duration-based quantities from Cox model results, such as the expected duration (or survival time) given covariate values and marginal changes in duration for a specified change in a covariate. These duration-based quantities often match better with researchers’ substantive interests and are easily understood by most readers. We describe the methods and illustrate use of the package.",

    "description": "Spatial statistics for infectious diseases are important because the spatial and temporal scale over which transmission operates determine the dynamics of disease spread. Many methods for quantifying the distribution and clustering of spatial point patterns have been developed (e.g. K function and pair correlation function) and are routinely applied to infectious disease case occurrence data. However, these methods do not explicitly account for overlapping chains of transmission and require knowledge of the underlying population distribution, which can be limiting when analyzing epidemic case occurrence data. Therefore, we developed two novel spatial statistics that account for these effects to estimate: 1) the mean of the spatial transmission kernel, and 2) the τ-statistic, a measure of global clustering based on pathogen subtype. We briefly introduce these statistics and show how to implement them using the IDSpatialStats R package.",

    "title": "Estimating Social Influence Effects in Networks Using A Latent Space Adjusted Approach in R ",
    "description": "Social influence effects have been extensively studied in various empirical network research. However, many challenges remain in estimating social influence effects in networks, as influence effects are often entangled with other factors, such as homophily in the selection process and the common social-environmental factors that individuals are embedded in. Methods currently available either do not solve these problems or require stringent assumptions. Recent works by Xu (2018) and others have shown that a latent space adjusted approach based on the latent space model has the potential to disentangle the influence effects from other processes, and the simulation evidence has shown that this approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of recovering the true social influence effect when there is an unobserved trait co-determining influence and selection. In this paper, I will further illustrate how the latent space adjusted approach can account for bias in the estimation of social influence effects and how this approach can be easily implemented in R.",

    "description": "A fixed point problem is one where we seek a vector, X, for a function, f, such that f(X) = X. The solution of many such problems can be accelerated by using a fixed point acceleration algorithm. With the release of the FixedPoint package there is now a number of algorithms available in R that can be used for accelerating the finding of a fixed point of a function. These algorithms include Newton acceleration, Aitken acceleration and Anderson acceleration as well as epsilon extrapolation methods and minimal polynomial methods. This paper demonstrates the use of fixed point accelerators in solving numerical mathematics problems using the algorithms of the FixedPoint package as well as the squarem method of the SQUAREM package.",

In this paper, we present the R package SemiCompRisks that provides functions to perform the analysis of independent/clustered semi-competing risks data under the illness-death multi-state model. The package allows the user to choose the specification for model components from a range of options giving users substantial flexibility, including: accelerated failure time or proportional hazards regression models; parametric or non-parametric specifications for baseline survival functions; parametric or non-parametric specifications for random effects distributions when the data are cluster correlated; and, a Markov or semi-Markov specification for terminal event following non-terminal event. While estimation is mainly performed within the Bayesian paradigm, the package also provides the maximum likelihood estimation for select parametric models. The package also includes functions for univariate survival analysis as complementary analysis tools.",

    "title": "RSSampling: A Pioneering Package for Ranked Set Sampling ",
    "description": "Ranked set sampling (RSS) is an advanced data collection method when the exact mea surement of an observation is difficult and/or expensive used in a number of research areas, e.g., environment, bioinformatics, ecology, etc. In this method, random sets are drawn from a population and the units in sets are ranked with a ranking mechanism which is based on a visual inspection or a concomitant variable. Because of the importance of working with a good design and easy analysis, there is a need for a software tool which provides sampling designs and statistical inferences based on RSS and its modifications. This paper introduces an R package as a free and easy-to-use analysis tool for both sampling processes and statistical inferences based on RSS and its modified versions. For researchers, the RSSampling package provides a sample with RSS, extreme RSS, median RSS, percentile RSS, balanced groups RSS, double versions of RSS, L-RSS, truncation-based RSS, and robust extreme RSS when the judgment rankings are both perfect and imperfect. Researchers can also use this new package to make parametric inferences for the population mean and the variance where the sample is obtained via classical RSS. Moreover, this package includes applications of the nonparametric methods which are one sample sign test, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test procedures. The package is available as RSSampling on CRAN.",

    "description": "The unival package is designed to help researchers decide between unidimensional and correlated factors solutions in the factor analysis of psychometric measures. The novelty of the approach is its use of external information, in which multiple factor scores and general factor scores are related to relevant external variables or criteria. The unival package’s implementation comes from a series of procedures put forward by Ferrando and Lorenzo-Seva (2019) and new methodological developments proposed in this article. We assess models fitted using unival by means of a simulation study extending the results obtained in the original proposal. Its usefulness is also assessed through a real-world data example. Based on these results, we conclude unival is a valuable tool for use in applications in which the dimensionality of an item set is to be assessed.",

    "description": "This paper presents a computational program named BINCOR (BINned CORrelation) for estimating the correlation between two unevenly spaced time series. This program is also applicable to the situation of two evenly spaced time series not on the same time grid. BINCOR is based on a novel estimation approach proposed by Mudelsee (2010) for estimating the correlation between two climate time series with different timescales. The idea is that autocorrelation (e.g. an AR1 process) means that memory enables values obtained on different time points to be correlated. Binned correlation is performed by resampling the time series under study into time bins on a regular grid, assigning the mean values of the variable under scrutiny within those bins. We present two examples of our BINCOR package with real data: instrumental and paleoclimatic time series. In both applications BINCOR works properly in detecting well-established relationships between the climate records compared.",

It provides functinos for assessing and comparing the goodness of fit and performance of models. In addition, the package may be used for analysis of the similarity of residuals and for identification of outliers and influential observations.

    "description": "This paper introduces the shadow package for R. The package provides functions for shadow related calculations in the urban environment, namely shadow height, shadow footprint and Sky View Factor (SVF) calculations, as well as a wrapper function to estimate solar radiation while taking shadow effects into account. All functions operate on a layer of polygons with a height attribute, also known as “extruded polygons” or 2.5D vector data. Such data are associated with accuracy limitations in representing urban environments. However, unlike 3D models, polygonal layers of building outlines along with their height are abundantly available and their processing does not require specialized closed-source 3D software. The present package thus brings spatio-temporal shadow, SVF and solar radiation calculation capabilities to the open-source spatial analysis workflow in R. Package functionality is demonstrated using small reproducible examples for each function. Wider potential use cases include urban environment applications such as evaluation of micro-climatic influence for urban planning, studying urban climatic comfort and estimating photovoltaic energy production potential.",

    "description": "High-throughput genomic technologies bring to light a comprehensive hallmark of molecular changes of a disease. It is increasingly evident that genes are not isolated from each other and the identification of a gene signature can only partially elucidate the de-regulated biological functions in a disease. The comprehension of how groups of genes (pathways) are related to each other (pathway cross talk) could explain biological mechanisms causing diseases. Biological pathways are important tools to identify gene interactions and decrease the large number of genes to be studied by partitioning them into smaller groups. Furthermore, recent scientific studies have demonstrated that an integration of pathways and networks, instead of a single component of the pathway or a single network, could lead to a deeper understanding of the pathology. StarBioTrek is an R package for the integration of biological pathways and networks which provides a series of functions to support the user in their analyses. In particular, it implements algorithms to identify pathways cross-talk networks and gene network drivers in pathways. It is available as open source and open development software in the Bioconductor platform.",

Unlike post-model-selection confidence intervals, the confidence interval that utilizes uncertain prior information (CIUUPI) implemented in this package has, to an excellent approximation, coverage probability throughout the parameter space that is very close to the desired minimum coverage probability. Furthermore, when the uncertain prior information is correct, the CIUUPI is, on average, shorter than the standard confidence interval constructed using the full linear regression model. In this paper we provide motivating examples of scenarios where the CIUUPI may be used. We then give a detailed description of this interval and the numerical constrained optimization method implemented in R to obtain it. Lastly, using a real data set as an illustrative example, we show how to use the functions in ciuupi.",

    "description": "Though longitudinal data often contain missing responses and error-prone covariates, relatively little work has been available to simultaneously correct for the effects of response missingness and covariate measurement error on analysis of longitudinal data. Yi (2008) proposed a simulation based marginal method to adjust for the bias induced by measurement error in covariates as well as by missingness in response. The proposed method focuses on modeling the marginal mean and variance structures, and the missing at random mechanism is assumed. Furthermore, the distribution of covariates are left unspecified. These features make the proposed method applicable to a broad settings. In this paper, we develop an R package, called swgee, which implements the method proposed by Yi (2008). Moreover, our package includes additional implementation steps which extend the setting considered by Yi (2008). To describe the use of the package and its main features, we report simulation studies and analyses of a data set arising from the Framingham Heart Study.",

Often, the number of clusters available to randomize is small (≤ 20), which increases the chance of baseline covariate imbalance between comparison arms. Such imbalance is particularly problematic when the covariates are predictive of the outcome because it can threaten the internal validity of the CRT. Pair-matching and stratification are two restricted randomization approaches that are frequently used to ensure balance at the design stage. An alternative, less commonly-used restricted randomization approach is covariate-constrained randomization. Covariate-constrained randomization quantifies baseline imbalance of cluster-level covariates using a balance metric and randomly selects a randomization scheme from those with acceptable balance by the balance metric. It is able to accommodate multiple covariates, both categorical and continuous. To facilitate imple mentation of covariate-constrained randomization for the design of two-arm parallel CRTs, we have developed the cvcrand R package. In addition, cvcrand also implements the clustered permutation test for analyzing continuous and binary outcomes collected from a CRT designed with covariate constrained randomization. We used a real cluster randomized trial to illustrate the functions included in the package.",

    "title": "jomo: A Flexible Package for Two-level Joint Modelling Multiple Imputation",
    "description": "Multiple imputation is a tool for parameter estimation and inference with partially observed data, which is used increasingly widely in medical and social research. When the data to be imputed are correlated or have a multilevel structure — repeated observations on patients, school children nested in classes within schools within educational districts — the imputation model needs to include this structure. Here we introduce our joint modelling package for multiple imputation of multilevel data, jomo, which uses a multivariate normal model fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Compared to previous packages for multilevel imputation, e.g. pan, jomo adds the facility to (i) handle and impute categorical variables using a latent normal structure, (ii) impute level-2 variables, and (iii) allow for cluster-specific covariance matrices, including the option to give them an inverse-Wishart distribution at level 2. The package uses C routines to speed up the computations and has been extensively validated in simulation studies both by ourselves and others.",

    "description": "The increasing availability of large but noisy data sets with a large number of heterogeneous variables leads to the increasing interest in the automation of common tasks for data analysis. The most time-consuming part of this process is the Exploratory Data Analysis, crucial for better domain understanding, data cleaning, data validation, and feature engineering. There is a growing number of libraries that attempt to automate some of the typical Exploratory Data Analysis tasks to make the search for new insights easier and faster. In this paper, we present a systematic review of existing tools for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (autoEDA). We explore the features of fifteen popular R packages to identify the parts of analysis that can be effectively automated with the current tools and to point out new directions for further autoEDA development.",

Such an approach may result in removing some relevant variables from consideration. Here we present an R package MDFS (MultiDimensional Feature Selection) that performs identification of informative variables taking into account synergistic interactions between multiple descriptors and the decision variable. MDFS is an implementation of an algorithm based on information theory (Mnich and Rudnicki, 2017). The computational kernel of the package is implemented in C++. A high-performance version implemented in CUDA C is also available. The application of MDFS is demonstrated using the well-known Madelon dataset, in which a decision variable is generated from synergistic interactions between descriptor variables. It is shown that the application of multidimen sional analysis results in better sensitivity and ranking of importance.",

Continuous variables are simulated using either Fleishman’s third order or Headrick’s fifth-order power method transformation. Simulation occurs at the component level for continuous mixture distributions, and the target correlation matrix is specified in terms of correlations with components. However, the package contains functions to approximate expected correlations with continuous mixture variables. There are two simulation pathways which calculate intermediate correlations involving count variables differently, increasing accuracy under a wide range of parameters. The package also provides functions to calculate cumulants of continuous mixture distributions, check parameter inputs, calculate feasible correlation boundaries, and summarize and plot simulated variables. SimCorrMix is an important addition to existing R simulation packages because it is the first to include continuous mixture and zero-inflated count variables in correlated data sets.",

    "description": "Most clustering strategies have not changed considerably since their initial definition. The common improvements are either related to the distance measure used to assess dissimilarity, or the function used to calculate prototypes. Time-series clustering is no exception, with the Dynamic Time Warping distance being particularly popular in that context. This distance is computationally expensive, so many related optimizations have been developed over the years. Since no single clustering algorithm can be said to perform best on all datasets, different strategies must be tested and compared, so a common infrastructure can be advantageous. In this manuscript, a general overview of shape-based time-series clustering is given, including many specifics related to Dynamic Time Warping and associated techniques. At the same time, a description of the dtwclust package for the R statistical software is provided, showcasing how it can be used to evaluate many different time-series clustering procedures.",

The R package focuses on the estimation of SDEs with linear random effects in the drift. The goal is to estimate the common density of the random effects from repeated discrete observations of the SDE. The package mixedsde proposes three estimation methods: a Bayesian parametric, a frequentist parametric and a frequentist nonparametric method. The three procedures are described as well as the main functions of the package. Illustrations are presented on simulated and real data.",

    "description": "Gaussian stochastic process (GaSP) emulation is a powerful tool for approximating compu tationally intensive computer models. However, estimation of parameters in the GaSP emulator is a challenging task. No closed-form estimator is available and many numerical problems arise with standard estimates, e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator. In this package, we implement a marginal posterior mode estimator, for special priors and parameterizations. This estimation method that meets the robust parameter estimation criteria was discussed in Gu et al. (2018); mathematical reasons are provided therein to explain why robust parameter estimation can greatly improve predictive performance of the emulator. In addition, inert inputs (inputs that almost have no effect on the variability of a function) can be identified from the marginal posterior mode estimation at no extra computational cost. The package also implements the parallel partial Gaussian stochastic process (PP GaSP) emulator (Gu and Berger (2016)) for the scenario where the computer model has multiple outputs on, for example, spatial-temporal coordinates. The package can be operated in a default mode, but also allows numerous user specifications, such as the capability of specifying trend functions and noise terms. Examples are studied herein to highlight the performance of the package in terms of out-of-sample prediction.",

    "description": "Fuzzy clustering methods discover fuzzy partitions where observations can be softly assigned to more than one cluster. The package fclust is a toolbox for fuzzy clustering in the R programming language. It not only implements the widely used fuzzy k-means (FkM) algorithm, but also many FkM variants. Fuzzy cluster similarity measures, cluster validity indices and cluster visualization tools are also offered. In the current version, all the functions are rewritten in the C++ language allowing their application in large-size problems. Moreover, new fuzzy relational clustering algorithms for partitioning qualitative/mixed data are provided together with an improved version of the so-called Gustafson-Kessel algorithm to avoid singularity in the cluster covariance matrices. Finally, it is now possible to automatically select the number of clusters by means of the available fuzzy cluster validity indices.",

    "description": "Matching is a well known technique to balance covariates distribution between treated and control units in non-experimental studies. In many fields, clustered data are a very common occurrence in the analysis of observational data and the clustering can add potentially interesting information. Matching algorithms should be adapted to properly exploit the hierarchical structure. In this article we present the CMatching package implementing matching algorithms for clustered data. The package provides functions for obtaining a matched dataset along with estimates of most common parameters of interest and model-based standard errors. A propensity score matching analysis, relating math proficiency with homework completion for students belonging to different schools (based on the NELS-88 data), illustrates in detail the use of the algorithms.",

    "description": "Record linkage aims at quickly and accurately identifying if two records represent the same real world entity. In many applications, we are interested in restricting the linkage results to \"1 to 1\" links, that is a single record does not appear more than once in the output. This can be dealt with the transport algorithm. The optimization problem, however, grows quadratically in the size of the input, quickly becoming untreatable for cases with a few thousand records. This paper compares different solutions, provided by some R packages for linear programming solvers. The comparison is done in terms of memory usage and execution time. The aim is to overcome the current implementation in the toolkit RELAIS, specifically developed for record linkage problems. The results highlight improvements beyond expectations. In fact the tested solutions allow successfully executing the \"1 to 1\" reduction for large size datasets up to the largest sample surveys at National Statistical Institutes.",

    "title": "Using Web Services to Work with Geodata in R",
    "description": "Through collaborative mapping, a massive amount of data is accessible. Many individuals contribute information each day. The growing amount of geodata is gathered by volunteers or obtained via crowd-sourcing. One outstanding example of this is the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Project which provides access to big data in geography. Another online mapping service that enables the integration of geodata into the analysis is Google Maps. The expanding content and the availability of geographic information radically changes the perspective on geodata (Chilton 2009). Recently many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been built on OSM and Google Maps. That leads to a point where it is possible to access sections of geographical information without the usage of a complex database solution, especially if one only requires a small data section for a visualization. First tools for spatial analysis have been included in the R language very early (Bivand and Gebhardt, 2000) and this development will continue to accelerate, underpinning a continual change. Notably, in recent years many tools have been developed to enable the usage of R as a geographic information system (GIS). With a GIS it is possible to process spatial data. QuantumGIS (QGIS) is a free software solution for these tasks, and a user interface is available for this purpose. R is, therefore, an alternative to geographic information systems like QGIS (QGIS Development Team 2009). Besides, add-ins for QGIS and R-packages (RQGIS) are available, that enables the combination of R and QGIS (Muenchow and Schratz 2017). It is the target of this article to present some of the most important R-functionalities to download and process geodata from OSM and the Google Maps API. The focus of this paper is on functions that enable the natural usage of these APIs.",

The core estimation is done with the Stan probabilistic programming language. In addition to being one of the few Bayesian implementations of DFA, novel features of this model include (1) optionally modeling latent process deviations as drawn from a Student-t distribution to better model extremes, and (2) optionally including autoregressive and moving-average components in the latent trends. Besides estimation, we provide a series of plotting functions to visualize trends, loadings, and model pre dicted values. A secondary analysis for some applications is to identify regimes in latent trends. We provide a flexible Bayesian implementation of a Hidden Markov Model — also written with Stan — to characterize regime shifts in latent processes. We provide simulation testing and details on parameter sensitivities in supplementary information.",

    "description": "The 4 Parameter Logistic (4PL) model has been recognized as a major tool to analyze the relationship between doses and responses in pharmacological experiments. A main strength of this model is that each parameter contributes an intuitive meaning enhancing interpretability of a fitted model. However, implementing the 4PL model using conventional statistical software often encounters numerical errors. This paper highlights the issue of convergence failure and presents several causes with solutions. These causes include outliers and a non-logistic data shape, so useful remedies such as robust estimation, outlier diagnostics and constrained optimization are proposed. These features are implemented in a new R package dr4pl (Dose-Response analysis using the 4 Parameter Logistic model) whose code examples are presented as a separate section. Our R package dr4pl is shown to work well for data sets where the traditional dose-response modelling packages drc and nplr fail.",

However, interventions are often implemented without a randomized control group for practical or ethical reasons. Propensity score matching (PSM) is a popular method for minimizing the effects of a randomized experiment from observational data by matching members of a treatment group to similar candidates that did not receive the intervention. Traditional PSM is not designed for studies that enroll participants on a rolling basis and does not provide a solution for interventions in which the baseline and intervention period are undefined in the comparison group. Rolling Entry Matching (REM) is a new matching method that addresses both issues. REM selects comparison members who are similar to intervention members with respect to both static (e.g., race) and dynamic (e.g., health conditions) characteristics. This paper will discuss the key components of REM and introduce the rollmatch R package.",

    "description": "This work introduces ShinyItemAnalysis, an R package and an online shiny application for psychometric analysis of educational tests and items. ShinyItemAnalysis covers a broad range of psy chometric methods and offers data examples, model equations, parameter estimates, interpretation of results, together with a selected R code, and is therefore suitable for teaching psychometric concepts with R. Furthermore, the application aspires to be an easy-to-use tool for analysis of educational tests by allowing the users to upload and analyze their own data and to automatically generate analysis reports in PDF or HTML. We argue that psychometric analysis should be a routine part of test development in order to gather proofs of reliability and validity of the measurement, and we demonstrate how ShinyItemAnalysis may help enforce this goal.",

We briefly introduce the main concepts of metrology and propagation of uncertainty, and discuss related R packages.

BETS provides not only thousands of Brazilian economic time series from different institutions, but also a range of analytical tools, and educational resources. In particular, BETS is capable of generating automated model reports for any given time series. These reports rely on a single function call and are able to build three types of models (SARIMA being one of them). The functions need few inputs and output rich content. The output varies according to the inputs and usually consists of a summary of the series properties, step-by-step explanations on how the model was developed, predictions made by the model, and a file containing these predictions. This work focuses on this feature and several other BETS functions that are designed to help in modeling time series. We present them in a thorough case study: the SARIMA approach to model and forecast the Brazilian production of intermediate goods index series.",

The implementation is efficient enough to allow for time-consuming discriminative scores on medium sized data sets. The bnclassify package provides utilities for model evaluation, such as cross-validated accuracy and penalized log-likelihood scores, and analysis of the underlying networks, including network plotting via the Rgraphviz package. It is extensively tested, with over 200 automated tests that give a code coverage of 94%.

    "description": "The increase in life expectancy followed by the burden of chronic diseases contributes to disability at older ages. The estimation of how much chronic conditions contribute to disability can be useful to develop public health strategies to reduce the burden. This paper introduces the R package addhaz, which is based on the attribution method (Nusselder and Looman, 2004) to partition disability into the additive contributions of diseases using cross-sectional data. The R package includes tools to fit the additive hazard model, the core of the attribution method, to binary and multinomial outcomes. The models are fitted by maximizing the binomial and multinomial log-likelihood functions using constrained optimization. Wald and bootstrap confidence intervals can be obtained for the parameter estimates. Also, the contribution of diseases to the disability prevalence and their bootstrap confidence intervals can be estimated. An additional feature is the possibility to use parallel computing to obtain the bootstrap confidence intervals. In this manuscript, we illustrate the use of addhaz with several examples for the binomial and multinomial models, using the data from the Brazilian National Health Survey, 2013.",

Challenges of parametric model specification and validation inspire a search for more data-driven and flexible nonparametric approaches for inference of complex networks. In this paper we discuss methodology and R implementation of two bootstrap procedures on random networks, that is, patchwork bootstrap of Thompson et al. (2016) and Gel et al. (2017) and vertex bootstrap of Snijders and Borgatti (1999). To our knowledge, the new R package snowboot is the first implementation of the vertex and patchwork bootstrap inference on networks in R. Our new package is accompanied with a detailed user’s manual, and is compatible with the popular R package on network studies igraph. We evaluate the patchwork bootstrap and vertex bootstrap with extensive simulation studies and illustrate their utility in an application to analysis of real world networks.",

While classical tests for independence are in the base R packages, there have been several recently developed tests for independence that are not available in R. This new package combines the classical tests including Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient method, Kendall’s τ rank correlation coefficient method and Spearman’s ρ rank correlation coefficient method with modern tests consisting of an empirical likelihood based test, a density-based empirical likelihood ratio test, Kallenberg data driven test, maximal information coefficient test, Hoeffding’s independence test and the continuous analysis of variance test. For two input vectors of observations, the function testforDEP provides a common interface for each of the tests and returns test statistics, corresponding p values and bootstrap confidence intervals as output. The function AUK provides an interface to visualize Kendall plots and computes the area under the Kendall plot similar to computing the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.",

Originally designed for military applications, this technique applies to any spatial point process where there is a desire to clearly understand the measurement of density and maintain fidelity of the point locations. Typical spatial density plotting algorithms, such as kernel density estimation, implement some type of smoothing function that often results in a density value that is difficult to interpret. The purpose of the visualization method in this paper is to understand spatial point activity density with precision and meaning. The temporal tendency of the point process as an extension of the point density methodology is also discussed and displayed. Applications include visualization and measurement of any type of spatial point process. Visualization techniques integrate ggmap with examples from San Diego crime data.",

    "description": "A lot of effort has been spent over the past few decades in the QCA methodology field, to develop efficient Boolean minimization algorithms to derive an exact, and more importantly complete list of minimal prime implicants that explain the initial, observed positive configurations. As the complexity grows exponentially with every new condition, the required computer memory goes past the current computer resources and the polynomial time required to solve this problem quickly grows towards infinity. This paper introduces a new alternative to the existing non-polynomial attempts. It completely solves the memory problem, and preliminary tests show it is exponentially hundreds of time faster than eQMC, the current “best” algorithm for QCA in R, and probes into a territory where it competes and even outperforms engineering algorithms such as Espresso, for exact minimizations. While speed is not much of an issue now (eQMC is fast enough for simple data), it might prove to be essential when further developing towards all possible temporal orders, or searching for configurations in panel data over time, combined with / or automatic detection of difficult counterfactuals etc.",

    "description": "Financial risk managers routinely use non–linear time series models to predict the downside risk of the capital under management. They also need to evaluate the adequacy of their model using so–called backtesting procedures. The latter involve hypothesis testing and evaluation of loss functions. This paper shows how the R package GAS can be used for both the dynamic prediction and the evaluation of downside risk. Emphasis is given to the two key financial downside risk measures: Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). High-level functions for: (i) prediction, (ii) backtesting, and (iii) model comparison are discussed, and code examples are provided. An illustration using the series of log–returns of the Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents is reported.",

    "description": "The R package jsr223 is a high-level integration for five programming languages in the Java platform: Groovy, JavaScript, JRuby, Jython, and Kotlin. Each of these languages can use Java objects in their own syntax. Hence, jsr223 is also an integration for R and the Java platform. It enables developers to leverage Java solutions from within R by embedding code snippets or evaluating script files. This approach is generally easier than rJava’s low-level approach that employs the Java Native Interface. jsr223’s multi-language support is dependent on the Java Scripting API: an implementation of “JSR-223: Scripting for the Java Platform” that defines a framework to embed scripts in Java applications. The jsr223 package also features extensive data exchange capabilities and a callback interface that allows embedded scripts to access the current R session. In all, jsr223 makes solutions developed in Java or any of the jsr223-supported languages easier to use in R.",

The stplanr package demonstrates and provides a home for such tools, with an emphasis on spatial transport data and non-motorized modes. The stplanr package facilitates common transport planning tasks including: downloading and cleaning transport datasets; creating geographic “desire lines” from origin-destination (OD) data; route assignment, locally and interfaces to routing services such as CycleStreets.net; calculation of route segment attributes such as bearing and aggregate flow; and ‘travel watershed’ analysis. This paper demonstrates this functionality using reproducible examples on real transport datasets. More broadly, the experience of developing and using R functions for transport applications shows that open source software can form the basis of a reproducible transport planning workflow. The stplanr package, alongside other packages and open source projects, could provide a more transparent and democratically accountable alternative to the current approach, which is heavily reliant on proprietary and relatively inaccessible software.",

Weisberg (2002) developed the dr-package to implement the four most popular SDR methods. However, the package does not provide any clear guidelines as to which method should be used given a data. Since the four methods may provide dramatically different dimension reduction results, the selection in the dr-package is problematic for statistical practitioners. In this paper, a basis-adaptive selection algorithm is developed in order to relieve this issue. The basic idea is to select an SDR method that provides the highest correlation between the basis estimates obtained by the four classical SDR methods. A real data example and numerical studies confirm the practical usefulness of the developed algorithm.",

Arguably, the most popular method to perform ICA is FastICA. There are two classical versions, the deflation-based FastICA where the components are found one by one, and the symmetric FastICA where the components are found simultaneously. These methods have been implemented previously in two R packages, fastICA and ica. We present the R package fICA and compare it to the other packages. Additional features in fICA include optimization of the extraction order in the deflation-based version, possibility to use any nonlinearity function, and improvement to convergence of the deflation-based algorithm. The usage of the package is demonstrated by applying it to the real ECG data of a pregnant woman.",

Uncertain variables are described by probability distributions. Both numerical and categorical data types are handled. The package also accommodates spatial auto-correlation within a variable and cross-correlation between variables. The MC realizations may be used as input to the environmental models written in or called from R.

There are many packages for spatio-temporal modeling. However, they often lack focus on time series, and exhibit statistical complexity. Here, we present the R package stilt designed for simplified AR(1) time series Gaussian process emulation, and provide examples relevant to climate modelling. Notably absent is Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation – a challenging concept to many scientists. We keep the number of user choices to a minimum. Hence, the package can be useful pedagogically, while still applicable to real life emulation problems. We provide functions for emulator cross-validation, empirical coverage, prediction, as well as response surface plotting. While the examples focus on climate model emulation, the emulator is general and can be also used for kriging spatio-temporal data.",

    "description": "Semi-Markov models, independently introduced by Lévy (1954), Smith (1955) and Takacs (1954), are a generalization of the well-known Markov models. For semi-Markov models, sojourn times can be arbitrarily distributed, while sojourn times of Markov models are constrained to be exponentially distributed (in continuous time) or geometrically distributed (in discrete time). The aim of this paper is to present the R package SMM, devoted to the simulation and estimation of discrete time multi-state semi-Markov and Markov models. For the semi-Markov case we have considered: parametric and non-parametric estimation; with and without censoring at the beginning and/or at the end of sample paths; one or several independent sample paths. Several discrete-time distributions are considered for the parametric estimation of sojourn time distributions of semi-Markov chains: Uniform, Geometric, Poisson, Discrete Weibull and Binomial Negative.",

    "description": "Learning classification tasks in which each instance is associated with one or more labels are known as multi-label learning. The implementation of multi-label algorithms, performed by different researchers, have several specificities, like input/output format, different internal functions, distinct programming language, to mention just some of them. As a result, current machine learning tools include only a small subset of multi-label decomposition strategies. The utiml package is a framework for the application of classification algorithms to multi-label data. Like the well known MULAN used with Weka, it provides a set of multi-label procedures such as sampling methods, transformation strategies, threshold functions, pre-processing techniques and evaluation metrics. The package was designed to allow users to easily perform complete multi-label classification experiments in the R environment. This paper describes the utiml API and illustrates its use in different multi-label classification scenarios.",

Most of the commercial statistical software provide routines for the standard ROC curve analysis.

In this work we introduce the nsROC package which incorporates some new ROC curve procedures. Particularly: ROC curve comparison based on general distances among functions for both paired and unpaired designs; efficient confidence bands construction; a generalization of the curve considering different classification subsets than the one involved in the classical defini tion of the ROC curve; a procedure to deal with censored data in cumulative-dynamic ROC curve estimation for time-to-event outcomes; and a non-parametric ROC curve method for meta-analysis. This is the only R package which implements these particular procedures.",

    "title": "mmpf: Monte-Carlo Methods for Prediction Functions",
    "description": "Machine learning methods can often learn high-dimensional functions which generalize well but are not human interpretable. The mmpf package marginalizes prediction functions using Monte-Carlo methods, allowing users to investigate the behavior of these learned functions, as on a lower dimensional subset of input features: partial dependence and variations thereof. This makes machine learning methods more useful in situations where accurate prediction is not the only goal, such as in the social sciences where linear models are commonly used because of their interpretability. Many methods for estimating prediction functions produce estimated functions which are not directly human-interpretable because of their complexity: for example, they may include high dimensional interactions and/or complex nonlinearities. While a learning method’s capacity to automatically learn interactions and nonlinearities is attractive when the goal is prediction, there are many cases where users want good predictions and the ability to understand how predictions depend on the features. mmpf implements general methods for interpreting prediction functions using Monte-Carlo methods. These methods allow any function which generates predictions to be be interpreted. mmpf is currently used in other packages for machine learning like edarf and mlr (Jones and Linder, 2016; Bischl et al., 2016).",

    "description": "“Dimensionality reduction” (DR) is a widely used approach to find low dimensional and interpretable representations of data that are natively embedded in high-dimensional spaces. DR can be realized by a plethora of methods with different properties, objectives, and, hence, (dis)advantages. The resulting low-dimensional data embeddings are often difficult to compare with objective criteria. Here, we introduce the dimRed and coRanking packages for the R language. These open source software packages enable users to easily access multiple classical and advanced DR methods using a common interface. The packages also provide quality indicators for the embeddings and easy visualization of high dimensional data. The coRanking package provides the functionality for assessing DR methods in the co-ranking matrix framework. In tandem, these packages allow for uncovering complex structures high dimensional data. Currently 15 DR methods are available in the package, some of which were not previously available to R users. Here, we outline the dimRed and coRanking packages and make the implemented methods understandable to the interested reader.",

    "description": "R is a powerful tool for data processing, visualization, and modeling. However, R is slower than other languages used for similar purposes, such as Python. One reason for this is that R lacks base support for collections, abstract data types that store, manipulate, and return data (e.g., sets, maps, stacks). An exciting recent trend in the R extension ecosystem is the development of collection packages, packages that provide classes that implement common collections. At least 12 collection packages are available across the two major R extension repositories, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and Bioconductor. In this article, we compare collection packages in terms of their features, design philosophy, ease of use, and performance on benchmark tests. We demonstrate that, when used well, the data structures provided by collection packages are in many cases significantly faster than the data structures provided by base R. We also highlight current deficiencies among R collection packages and propose avenues of possible improvement. This article provides useful recommendations to R programmers seeking to speed up their programs and aims to inform the development of future collection-oriented software for R.",

    "description": "Detecting outliers in a multivariate and unsupervised context is an important and ongoing problem notably for quality control. Many statistical methods are already implemented in R and are briefly surveyed in the present paper. But only a few lead to the accurate identification of potential outliers in the case of a small level of contamination. In this particular context, the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method shows remarkable properties for identifying outliers that lie on a low-dimensional subspace in its first invariant components. It is implemented in the ICSOutlier package. The main function of the package, ics.outlier, offers the possibility of labelling potential outliers in a completely automated way. Four examples, including two real examples in quality control, illustrate the use of the function. Comparing with several other approaches, it appears that ICS is generally as efficient as its competitors and shows an advantage in the context of a small proportion of outliers lying in a low-dimensional subspace. In quality control, the method may help in properly identifying some defective products while not detecting too many false positives.",

In an educational context, the model is referred to as a multidimensional value-added model, which extends previous theory to estimate the relationships between potential teacher contributions toward different student outcomes and to allow the consideration of a binary, real-world outcome such as graduation. The simultaneous joint modeling of continuous and binary outcomes was not available prior to RealVAMS due to computational difficulties.

The parametric functional forms are benchmarked against each other and a non-parametric transformation. The package allows users to generate plots that show the relation between a covariate and the dependent variable. Furthermore, PanJen will enable users to specify specific functional transformations, driven by a priori and theory-based hypotheses. The package supplies both model fits and plots that allow users to make informed choices on the functional forms in their regression.

    "title": "Tackling Uncertainties of Species Distribution Model Projections with Package mopa",
    "description": "Species Distribution Models (SDMs) constitute an important tool to assist decision-making in environmental conservation and planning in the context of climate change. Nevertheless, SDM pro jections are affected by a wide range of uncertainty factors (related to training data, climate projections and SDM techniques), which limit their potential value and credibility. The new package mopa pro vides tools for designing comprehensive multi-factor SDM ensemble experiments, combining multiple sources of uncertainty (e.g. baseline climate, pseudo-absence realizations, SDM techniques, future projections) and allowing to assess their contribution to the overall spread of the ensemble projection. In addition, mopa is seamlessly integrated with the climate4R bundle and allows straightforward retrieval and post-processing of state-of-the-art climate datasets (including observations and climate change projections), thus facilitating the proper analysis of key uncertainty factors related to climate data.",

    "description": "Fractional hot deck imputation (FHDI), proposed by Kalton and Kish (1984) and investigated by Kim and Fuller (2004), is a tool for handling item nonresponse in survey sampling. In FHDI, each missing item is filled with multiple observed values yielding a single completed data set for subsequent analyses. An R package FHDI is developed to perform FHDI and also the fully efficient fractional imputation (FEFI) method of (Fuller and Kim, 2005) to impute multivariate missing data with arbitrary missing patterns. FHDI substitutes missing items with a few observed values jointly obtained from a set of donors whereas the FEFI uses all the possible donors. This paper introduces FHDI as a tool for implementing the multivariate version of fractional hot deck imputation discussed in Im et al. (2015) as well as FEFI. For variance estimation of FHDI and FEFI, the Jackknife method is implemented, and replicated weights are provided as a part of the output.",

In general, as companies seek to minimize economic losses, studies on problems of multi-agent inventory have increased in recent years. A multi-agent inventory problem is a situation in which several agents face individual inventory problems and agree to coordinate their orders with the objective of reducing their costs. The R package Inventorymodel allows the determination of both the optimal policy for some inventory situations with deterministic demands and the allocation of costs from a game-theoretic perspective. The required calculations may be computed for any number of agents although the computational complexity of this class of problems when the involved agents enlarge is not reduced. In this work, the different possibilities that the package offers are described and some examples of usage are also demonstrated.",

    "description": "Missing observations are common in time series data and several methods are available to impute these values prior to analysis. Variation in statistical characteristics of univariate time series can have a profound effect on characteristics of missing observations and, therefore, the accuracy of different imputation methods. The imputeTestbench package can be used to compare the prediction accuracy of different methods as related to the amount and type of missing data for a user-supplied dataset. Missing data are simulated by removing observations completely at random or in blocks of different sizes depending on characteristics of the data. Several imputation algorithms are included with the package that vary from simple replacement with means to more complex interpolation methods. The testbench is not limited to the default functions and users can add or remove methods as needed. Plotting functions also allow comparative visualization of the behavior and effectiveness of different algorithms. We present example applications that demonstrate how the package can be used to understand differences in prediction accuracy between methods as affected by characteristics of a dataset and the nature of missing data.",

Relational databases provide a solution, but in order to be useful, must be able to be linked to analysis and visualization tools, such as R. Here, we present a package intended to facilitate integration of R with the open-source database software PostgreSQL, with a focus on its spatial extension, PostGIS. The package rpostgis (version 1.4.1) provides methods for spatial data handling (vector and raster) between PostGIS-enabled databases and R, methods for R \"data.frame\"s storage in PostgreSQL, and a set of convenient wrappers for common database procedures. We thus expect rpostgis to be useful for both (1) existing users of spatial data in R and/or PostGIS, and (2) R users who have yet to adopt relational databases for their projects.",

Rather than selecting a particular parametric exponential family model, such as the Poisson distribution, this semiparametric glm assumes that the response is drawn from the more general exponential tilt family. The regression coefficients and unspecified reference distribution are estimated by maximizing a semiparametric like lihood. The new algorithm incorporates several computational stability and efficiency improvements over the algorithm originally proposed. In particular, the new algorithm performs well for either small or large support for the nonparametric response distribution. The algorithm is implemented in a new R package called gldrm.",

Therefore, it is necessary to derive new inference methods capable of dealing with high dimensionality, and to make them available to statistics practitioners. One such method is implemented in the package HRM described in this article. This new method uses a similar approach as the Welch-Satterthwaite t-test approximation and works very well for high-dimensional data as long as the data distribution is not too skewed or heavy-tailed. The package also provides a GUI to offer an easy way to apply the methods.",

Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. Multivariate models can be fit as well. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing relevant aspects of the syntax.",

    "title": "InfoTrad: An R package for estimating the probability of informed trading",
    "description": "The purpose of this paper is to introduce the R package InfoTrad for estimating the proba bility of informed trading (PIN) initially proposed by Easley et al. (1996). PIN is a popular information asymmetry measure that proxies the proportion of informed traders in the market. This study provides a short survey on alternative estimation techniques for the PIN. There are many problems documented in the existing literature in estimating PIN. InfoTrad package aims to address two problems. First, the sequential trading structure proposed by Easley et al. (1996) and later extended by Easley et al. (2002) is prone to sample selection bias for stocks with large trading volumes, due to floating point exception. This problem is solved by different factorizations provided by Easley et al. (2010) (EHO factorization) and Lin and Ke (2011) (LK factorization). Second, the estimates are prone to bias due to boundary solutions. A grid-search algorithm (YZ algorithm) is proposed by Yan and Zhang (2012) to overcome the bias introduced due to boundary estimates. In recent years, clustering algorithms have become popular due to their flexibility in quickly handling large data sets. Gan et al. (2015) propose an algorithm (GAN algorithm) to estimate PIN using hierarchical agglomerative clustering which is later extended by Ersan and Alici (2016) (EA algorithm). The package InfoTrad offers LK and EHO factorizations given an input matrix and initial parameter vector. In addition, these factorizations can be used to estimate PIN through YZ algorithm, GAN algorithm and EA algorithm.",

    "description": "Data analysis, common to all empirical sciences, often requires complete data sets. Unfortu nately, real world data collection will usually result in data values not being observed. We present a package for robust multiple imputation (the ImputeRobust package) that allows the use of generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape in the context of chained equations. The paper describes the basics of the imputation technique which builds on a semi-parametric regression model (GAMLSS) and the algorithms and functions provided with the corresponding package. Furthermore, some illustrative examples are provided.",

Three approaches are available in the package: The regression approach takes censoring into account when formulating the inequality constraints of the support vector problem. In the ranking approach, the inequality constraints set the objective to maximize the concordance index for comparable pairs of observations. The hybrid approach combines the regression and ranking constraints in a single model. We describe survival support vector machines and their implementation, provide examples and compare the prediction performance with the Cox proportional hazards model, random survival forests and gradient boosting using several real datasets. On these datasets, survival support vector machines perform on par with the reference methods.",

We present a family of nonparametric tests that are computationally efficient and powerful for detecting any type of dependence between a pair of univariate random variables. The computational complexity of the suggested tests is sub-quadratic in sample size, allowing calculation of test statistics for millions of observations. We survey both algorithms and the HHG package in which they are implemented, with usage examples showing the implementation of the proposed tests for both the independence case and the k-sample problem. The tests are compared to existing nonparametric tests via several simulation studies comparing both runtime and power. Special focus is given to the design of data structures used in implementation of the tests. These data structures can be useful for developers of nonparametric distribution-free tests.",

Analytical solutions for the density and distribution are usually cumbersome to find and difficult to compute. Several methods have been developed to approximate the distribution, among which is the saddlepoint approximation. However, implementation of the saddlepoint approximation is non-trivial. In this paper, we implement the saddlepoint approximation in the sinib package and provide two examples to illustrate its usage. One example uses simulated data while the other uses real-world healthcare data. The sinib package addresses the gap between the theory and the implementation of approximating the sum of independent non-identical binomials.",

From the user’s point of view, the function is similar to coxph (in the survival package) and other widely used model-fitting functions. Convenient software has not previously been available for Estimator III since it is complicated to calculate. SAS and S-Plus code-fragments for the calculation have been published, but cchs is easier to use and more efficient in terms of time and memory, and can cope with much larger datasets. It also avoids several minor approximations and simplifications.",

    "description": "Efficiently producing transparent analyses may be difficult for beginners or tedious for the experienced. This implies a need for computing systems and environments that can efficiently satisfy reproducibility and accountability standards. To this end, we have developed a system, R package, and R Shiny application called adapr (Accountable Data Analysis Process in R) that is built on the principle of accountable units. An accountable unit is a data file (statistic, table or graphic) that can be associated with a provenance, meaning how it was created, when it was created and who created it, and this is similar to the ’verifiable computational results’ (VCR) concept proposed by Gavish and Donoho. Both accountable units and VCRs are version controlled, sharable, and can be incorporated into a collaborative project. However, accountable units use file hashes and do not involve watermarking or public repositories like VCRs. Reproducing collaborative work may be highly complex, requiring repeating computations on multiple systems from multiple authors; however, determining the provenance of each unit is simpler, requiring only a search using file hashes and version control systems.",

    "title": "Epistemic Game Theory: Putting Algorithms to Work",
    "description": "The aim of this study is to construct an epistemic model in which each rational choice under common belief in rationality is supplemented by a type which expresses such a belief. In practice, the finding of type depends on manual solution approach with some mathematical operations in scope of the theory. This approach becomes less convenient with the growth of the size of the game. To solve this difficulty, a linear programming model is constructed for two-player, static and non-cooperative games to find the type that is supporting that player’s rational choice is optimal under common belief in rationality and maximizing the utility of the game. Since the optimal choice would only be made from rational choices, it is first necessary to eliminate all strictly dominated choices. In real life, the games are usually large sized. Therefore, the elimination process should be performed in a computer environment. Since software related to game theory was mostly prepared with a result-oriented approach for some types of games, it was necessary to develop software to execute the iterated elimination method. With this regard, a program has been developed that determines the choices that are strictly dominated by pure and randomized choices in two-player games. Two functions named “esdc” and “type” are created by using R statistical programming language for the operations performed in both parts, and these functions are added to the content of an R package after its creation with the name EpistemicGameTheory.",

    "title": "rpsftm: An R Package for Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time Models",
    "description": "Treatment switching in a randomised controlled trial occurs when participants change from their randomised treatment to the other trial treatment during the study. Failure to account for treatment switching in the analysis (i.e. by performing a standard intention-to-treat analysis) can lead to biased estimates of treatment efficacy. The rank preserving structural failure time model (RPSFTM) is a method used to adjust for treatment switching in trials with survival outcomes. The RPSFTM is due to Robins and Tsiatis (1991) and has been developed by White et al. (1997, 1999). The method is randomisation based and uses only the randomised treatment group, observed event times, and treatment history in order to estimate a causal treatment effect. The treatment effect, ψ, is estimated by balancing counter-factual event times (that would be observed if no treatment were received) between treatment groups. G-estimation is used to find the value of ψ such that a test statistic Z (ψ) = 0. This is usually the test statistic used in the intention-to-treat analysis, for example, the log rank test statistic. We present an R package, rpsftm, that implements the method.",

    "title": "RQGIS: Integrating R with QGIS for Statistical Geocomputing",
    "description": "Integrating R with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) extends R’s statistical capabilities with numerous geoprocessing and data handling tools available in a GIS. QGIS is one of the most popular open-source GIS, and it furthermore integrates other GIS programs such as the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) GIS and the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS within a single software environment. This and its QGIS Python API makes it a perfect candidate for console-based geoprocessing. By establishing an interface, the R package RQGIS makes it possible to use QGIS as a geoprocessing workhorse from within R. Compared to other packages building a bridge to GIS (e.g., rgrass7, RSAGA, RPyGeo), RQGIS offers a wider range of geoalgorithms, and is often easier to use due to various convenience functions. Finally, RQGIS supports the seamless integration of Python code using reticulate from within R for improved extendability.",

First, it calculates the change in the probability of the event occurring given a change in a theoretical variable. Second, it calculates the rolling difference in the future probability of the event for two scenarios: one where the event occurred at a given time and one where the event does not occur. The package is consistent with the recent movement to depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret quantities of interest with the requisite measures of uncertainty. It is the first to make it easy for researchers to interpret shortand long-term effects of explanatory variables in binary autoregressive models, which can have important implications for the correct interpretation of these models.",

We provide explicit formulas for our implementation of the estimator of the (stratified) baseline hazard function in the presence of tied event times. As a by-product we obtain fast access to the baseline hazards (compared to survival::basehaz()) and predictions of survival probabilities, their confidence intervals and confidence bands.

When genotypes of related individuals are available in a number of linked genetic markers, the program starts by identifying haplotypes compatible with the observed genotypes in those markers without missing values. If haplotypes are identified in parents or offspring, missing alleles can be imputed in subjects containing missing values. Several scenarios are analyzed: family completely genotyped, children partially genotyped and parents completely genotyped, children fully genotyped and parents containing entirely or partially missing genotypes, and founders and their offspring both only partially genotyped. The alleHap package also has a function to simulate pedigrees including all these scenarios. This article describes in detail how our package works for the desired applications, including illustrated explanations and easily reproducible examples.",

    "description": "Recently, Mazucheli (2017) uploaded the package mle.tools to CRAN. It can be used for bias corrections of maximum likelihood estimates through the methodology proposed by Cox and Snell (1968). The main function of the package, coxsnell.bc(), computes the bias corrected maximum likelihood estimates. Although in general, the bias corrected estimators may be expected to have better sampling properties than the uncorrected estimators, analytical expressions from the formula proposed by Cox and Snell (1968) are either tedious or impossible to obtain. The purpose of this paper is twofolded: to introduce the mle.tools package, especially the coxsnell.bc() function; secondly, to compare, for thirty one continuous distributions, the bias estimates from the coxsnell.bc() function and the bias estimates from analytical expressions available in the literature. We also compare, for five distributions, the observed and expected Fisher information. Our numerical experiments show that the functions are efficient to estimate the biases by the Cox-Snell formula and for calculating the observed and expected Fisher information.",

    "description": "In many data analyses, the dimensionality of the observed data is high while its intrinsic dimension remains quite low. Estimating the intrinsic dimension of an observed dataset is an essential preliminary step for dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, and visualization. This paper introduces an R package, named ider, that implements eight intrinsic dimension estimation methods, including a recently proposed method based on a second-order expansion of a probability mass function and a generalized linear model. The usage of each function in the package is explained with datasets generated using a function that is also included in the package.",

    "description": "We present the BayesBD package providing Bayesian inference for boundaries of noisy images. The BayesBD package implements flexible Gaussian process priors indexed by the circle to recover the boundary in a binary or Gaussian noised image. The boundary recovered by BayesBD has the practical advantages of guaranteed geometric restrictions and convenient joint inferences under certain assumptions, in addition to its desirable theoretical property of achieving (nearly) minimax optimal rate in a way that is adaptive to the unknown smoothness. The core sampling tasks for our model have linear complexity, and are implemented in C++ for computational efficiency using packages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. Users can access the full functionality of the package in both the command line and the corresponding shiny application. Additionally, the package includes numerous utility functions to aid users in data preparation and analysis of results. We compare BayesBD with selected existing packages using both simulations and real data applications, demonstrating the excellent performance and flexibility of BayesBD even when the observation contains complicated structural information that may violate its assumptions.",

    "description": "Requiring no analytical forms, nonparametric discrete patterns are flexible in representing complex relationships among random variables. This makes them increasingly useful for data-driven applications. However, there appears to be no software tools for simulating nonparametric discrete patterns, which prevents objective evaluation of statistical methods that discover discrete relationships from data. We present a simulator to generate nonparametric discrete functions as contingency tables. User can request strictly many-to-one functional patterns. The simulator can also produce contingency tables representing dependent non-functional and independent relationships. An option is provided to apply random noise to contingency tables. We demonstrate the utility of the simulator by showing the advantage of the FunChisq test over Pearson’s chi-square test in detecting functional patterns. This simulator, implemented in the function simulate_tables in the R package FunChisq (version 2.4.0 or greater), offers an important means to evaluate the performance of nonparametric statistical pattern discovery methods.",

Here, we introduce an R package, visreg, for the convenient visualization of this relationship via short, simple function calls. In addition to estimates of this relationship, the package also provides pointwise confidence bands and partial residuals to allow assessment of variability as well as outliers and other deviations from modeling assumptions. The package provides several options for visualizing models with interactions, including lattice plots, contour plots, and both static and interactive perspective plots. The implementation of the package is designed to be fully object-oriented and interface seamlessly with R’s rich collection of model classes, allowing a consistent interface for visualizing not only linear models, but generalized linear models, proportional hazards models, generalized additive models, robust regression models, and many more.",

An extensive toolbox is available in the R-extension package arules. However, mining association rules often results in a vast number of found rules, leaving the analyst with the task to go through a large set of rules to identify interesting ones. Sifting manually through extensive sets of rules is time-consuming and strenuous. Visualization and espe cially interactive visualization has a long history of making large amounts of data better accessible. The R-extension package arulesViz provides most popular visualization techniques for association rules. In this paper, we discuss recently added interactive visualizations to explore association rules and demonstrate how easily they can be used in arulesViz via a unified interface. With examples, we help to guide the user in selecting appropriate visualizations and interpreting the results.",

    "description": "A new R package is presented for dealing with non-normality and variance heterogeneity of sample data when conducting hypothesis tests of main effects and interactions in mixed models. The proposal departs from an existing SAS program which implements Johansen’s general formulation of Welch-James’s statistic with approximate degrees of freedom, which makes it suitable for testing any linear hypothesis concerning cell means in univariate and multivariate mixed model designs when the data pose non-normality and non-homogeneous variance. Improved type I error rate control is obtained using bootstrapping for calculating an empirical critical value, whereas robustness against non-normality is achieved through trimmed means and Winsorized variances. A wrapper function eases the application of the test in common situations, such as performing omnibus tests on all effects and interactions, pairwise contrasts, and tetrad contrasts of two-way interactions. The package is demonstrated in several problems including unbalanced univariate and multivariate designs.",

    "description": "We present the R package fourierin (Basulto-Elias, 2017) for evaluating functions defined as Fourier-type integrals over a collection of argument values. The integrals are finitely supported with integrands involving continuous functions of one or two variables. As an important application, such Fourier integrals arise in so-called “inversion formulas”, where one seeks to evaluate a probability density at a series of points from a given characteristic function (or vice versa) through Fourier transforms. This paper intends to fill a gap in current R software, where tools for repeated evaluation of functions as Fourier integrals are not directly available. We implement two approaches for such computations with numerical integration. In particular, if the argument collection for evaluation corresponds to a regular grid, then an algorithm from Inverarity (2002) may be employed based on a fast Fourier transform, which creates significant improvements in the speed over a second approach to numerical Fourier integration (where the latter also applies to cases where the points for evaluation are not on a grid). We illustrate the package with the computation of probability densities and characteristic functions through Fourier integrals/transforms, for both univariate and bivariate examples.",

    "description": "The dGAselID package proposes an original approach to feature selection in high dimen sional data. The method is built upon a diploid genetic algorithm. The genotype to phenotype mapping is modeled after the Incomplete Dominance Inheritance, overpassing the necessity to define a dominance scheme. The fitness evaluation is done by user selectable supervised classifiers, from a broad range of options. Cross validation options are also accessible. A new approach to crossover, inspired from the random assortment of chromosomes during meiosis is included. Several mutation operators, inspired from genetics, are also proposed. The package is fully compatible with the data formats used in Bioconductor and MLInterfaces package, readily applicable to microarray studies, but is flexible to other feature selection applications from high dimensional data. Several options for the visualization of evolution and outcomes are implemented to facilitate the interpretation of results. The package’s functionality is illustrated by examples.",

    "description": "Semi-parametric approaches based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) are widely used to analyze correlated outcomes in longitudinal settings. In this paper, we present a package CRTgeeDR developed for cluster randomized trials with missing data (CRTs). For use of inverse probability weighting to adjust for missing data in cluster randomized trials, we show that other software lead to biased estimation for non-independence working correlation structure. CRTgeeDR solves this problem. We also extend the ability of existing packages to allow augmented Doubly Robust GEE estimation (DR). Simulation studies demonstrate the consistency of estimators implemented in CRTgeeDR compared to packages such as geepack and the gains associated with the use of the DR for analyzing a binary outcome using a logistic regression. Finally, we illustrate the method on data from a sanitation CRT in developing countries.",

    "title": "anomalyDetection: Implementation of Augmented Network Log Anomaly Detection Procedures",
    "description": "As the number of cyber-attacks continues to grow on a daily basis, so does the delay in threat detection. For instance, in 2015, the Office of Personnel Management discovered that approximately 21.5 million individual records of Federal employees and contractors had been stolen. On average, the time between an attack and its discovery is more than 200 days. In the case of the OPM breach, the attack had been going on for almost a year. Currently, cyber analysts inspect numerous potential incidents on a daily basis, but have neither the time nor the resources available to perform such a task. anomalyDetection aims to curtail the time frame in which anomalous cyber activities go unnoticed and to aid in the efficient discovery of these anomalous transactions among the millions of daily logged events by i) providing an efficient means for pre-processing and aggregating cyber data for analysis by employing a tabular vector transformation and handling multicollinearity concerns; ii) offering numerous built-in multivariate statistical functions such as Mahalanobis distance, factor analysis, principal components analysis to identify anomalous activity, iii) incorporating the pipe operator (%>%) to allow it to work well in the tidyverse workflow. Combined, anomalyDetection offers cyber analysts an efficient and simplified approach to break up network events into time-segment blocks and identify periods associated with suspected anomalies for further evaluation.",

The functions provided comprise matrix logarithm based approximations as described in Israel et al.

For the expectation maximization algorithm Wald confidence intervals based on the Fisher information estimation method of Oakes (1999) are provided. For the Gibbs sampling approach, equal-tailed credibility intervals can be obtained. In order to visualize the parameter estimates, a matrix plot function is provided. The methods described are illustrated by Standard and Poor’s discrete-time corporate credit rating transition data.",

Software implementations of MAD exist in C++ and C# to import data, execute an ensemble of forward model simulations, and perform basic post-processing of calculating likelihood and posterior distributions for a given application. This article describes the R package anchoredDistr that has been built to provide an R based environment for this method. In particular, anchoredDistr provides a range of post-processing capabilities for MAD software by taking advantage of the statistical capabilities and wide use of the R language. Two examples from stochastic hydrogeology are provided to highlight the features of the package for MAD applications in inferring anchored distributions of local parameters (e.g. point values of transmissivity) as well as global parameters (e.g. the mean of the spatial random function for hydraulic conductivity).",

These features, known as annotations, are usually stored internally in hierarchical, tree-based data structures. This paper proposes a data model to represent annotations as a collection of normalized relational data tables optimized for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling. The R package cleanNLP, which calls one of two state of the art NLP libraries (CoreNLP or spaCy), is presented as an implementation of this data model. It takes raw text as an input and returns a list of normalized tables. Specific annotations provided include tokenization, part of speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, dependency parsing, coreference resolution, and word embeddings. The package currently supports input text in English, German, French, and Spanish.",

Interrogation of metabolic reconstructions are generally carried through Flux Balance Analysis, an optimization method in which the biological sense of the optimal solution is highly sensitive to thermodynamic unbalance caused by the presence of stoichiometric reactions whose compounds are not produced or consumed in any other reaction (orphan metabolites) and by mass unbalance. The minval package was designed as a tool to identify orphan metabolites and evaluate the mass and charge balance of stoichiometric reactions. The package also includes functions to characterize and write models in TSV and SBML formats, extract all reactants, products, metabolite names and compartments from a metabolic reconstruction.",

This processing can be particularly extensive when identifying and characterizing multi-day extreme events like heat waves and frost day spells, as these must be processed from model output with daily time steps. Further, climate model output is in a format and follows standards that may be unfamiliar to most R users. Here, we provide an overview of working with daily climate model output data in R. We then present the futureheatwaves package, which we developed to ease the process of identifying, characterizing, and exploring multi-day extreme events in climate model output. This package can input a directory of climate model output files, identify all extreme events using customizable event definitions, and summarize the output using user-specified functions.",

However, this flexibility has its price: As the R interpreter has no information about the expected variable type, many base functions automatically convert the input instead of raising an exception. Unfortunately, this frequently leads to runtime errors deeper down the call stack which obfuscates the original problem and renders debugging challenging. Even worse, unwanted conver sions can remain undetected and skew or invalidate the results of a statistical analysis. As a resort, assertions can be employed to detect unexpected input during runtime and to signal understandable and traceable errors. The package checkmate provides a plethora of functions to check the type and related properties of the most frequently used R objects and variable types. The package is mostly written in C to avoid any unnecessary performance overhead. Thus, the programmer can conveniently write concise, well-tested assertions which outperforms custom R code for many applications. Fur thermore, checkmate simplifies writing unit tests using the framework testthat (Wickham, 2011) by extending it with plenty of additional expectation functions, and registered C routines are available for package developers to perform assertions on arbitrary SEXPs (internal data structure for R objects implemented as struct in C) in compiled code.",

The functions chunk.apply and read.chunk are supplied to allow for iteratively loading contiguous blocks of data into memory as raw vectors. These raw vectors can then be efficiently converted into matrices and data frames with the iotools functions mstrsplit and dstrsplit. These functions minimize copying of data and avoid the use of intermediate strings in order to drastically improve performance. Finally, we also provide read.csv.raw to allow users to read an entire dataset into memory with the same efficient parsing code. In this paper, we present these functions through a set of examples with an emphasis on the flexibility provided by chunk-wise operations. We provide benchmarks comparing the speed of read.csv.raw to data loading functions provided in base R and other contributed packages.",

    "description": "Linguistic distance measurements are commonly used in anthropology and biology when quantitative and statistical comparisons between words are needed. This is common, for example, when analyzing linguistic and genetic data. Such comparisons can provide insight into historical population patterns and evolutionary processes. However, the most commonly used linguistic distances are derived from edit distances, which do not weight phonetic features that may, for example, represent smaller-scale patterns in linguistic evolution. Thus, computational methods for calculating feature-weighted linguistic distances are needed for linguistic, biological, and evolutionary applications; additionally, the linguistic distances presented here are generic and may have broader applications in fields such as text mining and search, as well as applications in psycholinguistics and morphology. To facilitate this research, we are making available an open-source R software package that performs feature-weighted linguistic distance calculations. The package also includes a supervised learning methodology that uses a genetic algorithm and manually determined alignments to estimate 13 linguistic parameters including feature weights and a skip penalty. Here we present the package and use it to demonstrate the supervised learning methodology by estimating the optimal linguistic parameters for both simulated data and for a sample of Austronesian languages. Our results show that the methodology can estimate these parameters for both simulated and real language data, that optimizing feature weights improves alignment accuracy by approximately 29%, and that optimization significantly affects the resulting distance measurements.

    "title": "Implementing a Metapopulation Bass Diffusion Model using the R Package deSolve",
    "description": "Diffusion is a fundamental process in physical, biological, social and economic settings. Consumer products often go viral, with sales driven by the word of mouth effect, as their adoption spreads through a population. The classic diffusion model used for product adoption is the Bass diffusion model, and this divides a population into two groups of people: potential adopters who are likely to adopt a product, and adopters who have purchased the product, and influence others to adopt. The Bass diffusion model is normally captured in an aggregate form, where no significant consumer differences are modeled. This paper extends the Bass model to capture a spatial perspective, using metapopulation equations from the field of infectious disease modeling. The paper’s focus is on simulation of deterministic models by solving ordinary differential equations, and does not encompass parameter estimation. The metapopulation model in implemented in R using the deSolve package, and shows the potential of using the R framework to implement large-scale integral equation models, with applications in the field of marketing and consumer behaviour.",

    "description": "The MDplot package provides plotting functions to allow for automated visualisation of molecular dynamics simulation output. It is especially useful in cases where the plot generation is rather tedious due to complex file formats or when a large number of plots are generated. The graphs that are supported range from those which are standard, such as RMSD/RMSF (root-mean-square deviation and root-mean-square fluctuation, respectively) to less standard, such as thermodynamic integration analysis and hydrogen bond monitoring over time. All told, they address many com monly used analyses. In this article, we set out the MDplot package’s functions, give examples of the function calls, and show the associated plots. Plotting and data parsing is separated in all cases, i.e. the respective functions can be used independently. Thus, data manipulation and the integration of additional file formats is fairly easy. Currently, the loading functions support GROMOS, GROMACS, and AMBER file formats. Moreover, we also provide a Bash interface that allows simple embedding of MDplot into Bash scripts as the final analysis step. Availability: The package can be obtained in the latest major version from CRAN (https://cran.r project.org/package=MDplot) or in the most recent version from the project’s GitHub page at https://github.com/MDplot/MDplot, where feedback is also most welcome.

The R package GA provides a collection of general purpose functions for optimisation using genetic algorithms. This paper describes some enhancements recently introduced in version 3 of the package. In particular, hybrid GAs have been implemented by including the option to perform local searches during the evolution. This allows to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local optimiser. Another major improvement is the provision of facilities for parallel computing. Parallelisation has been implemented using both the master-slave approach and the islands evolution model. Several examples of usage are presented, with both real-world data examples and benchmark functions, showing that often high-quality solutions can be obtained more efficiently.",

It offers multiple state-of-the-art imputation algorithm implementations along with plotting functions for time series missing data statistics. While imputation in general is a well-known problem and widely covered by R packages, finding packages able to fill missing values in univariate time series is more complicated. The reason for this lies in the fact, that most imputation algorithms rely on inter-attribute correlations, while univariate time series imputation instead needs to employ time dependencies. This paper provides an introduction to the imputeTS package and its provided algorithms and tools. Furthermore, it gives a short overview about univariate time series imputation in R.",

    "description": "In Data Mining, the value of extracted knowledge is directly related to the quality of the used data. This makes data preprocessing one of the most important steps in the knowledge discovery process. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise. A training set with label noise can reduce the predictive performance of classification learning techniques and increase the overfitting of classification models. In this work we present the NoiseFiltersR package. It contains the first extensive R implementation of classical and state-of-the-art label noise filters, which are the most common techniques for preprocessing label noise. The algorithms used for the implementation of the label noise filters are appropriately documented and referenced. They can be called in a R-user-friendly manner, and their results are unified by means of the \"filter\" class, which also benefits from adapted print and summary methods.",

This makes data\npreprocessing one of the most important steps in the knowledge discovery\nprocess. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of\nnoise. A training set with label noise can reduce the predictive\nperformance of classification learning techniques and increase the\noverfitting of classification models. In this work we present the\nNoiseFiltersR package. It contains the first extensive R implementation\nof classical and state-of-the-art label noise filters, which are the\nmost common techniques for preprocessing label noise. The algorithms\nused for the implementation of the label noise filters are appropriately\ndocumented and referenced. They can be called in a R-user-friendly\nmanner, and their results are unified by means of the “filter” class,\nwhich also benefits from adapted print and summary methods. author: -\nPablo Morales - Julián Luengo - Luís P.F.

    "description": "In this paper, we describe an R package named coxphMIC, which implements the sparse estimation method for Cox proportional hazards models via approximated information criterion (Su et al., 2016). The developed methodology is named MIC which stands for “Minimizing approximated Information Criteria\". A reparameterization step is introduced to enforce sparsity while at the same time keeping the objective function smooth. As a result, MIC is computationally fast with a superior performance in sparse estimation. Furthermore, the reparameterization tactic yields an additional advantage in terms of circumventing post-selection inference (Leeb and Pötscher, 2005). The MIC method and its R implementation are introduced and illustrated with the PBC data.",

    "title": "Update of the nlme Package to Allow a Fixed Standard Deviation of the Residual Error",
    "description": "The use of linear and non-linear mixed models in the life sciences and pharmacometrics is common practice. Estimation of the parameters of models not involving a system of differential equations is often done by the R or S-Plus software with the nonlinear mixed effects nlme package. The estimated residual error may be used for diagnosis of the fitted model, but not whether the model correctly describes the relation between response and included variables including the true covariance structure. The latter is only true if the residual error is known in advance. Therefore, it may be necessary or more appropriate to fix the residual error a priori instead of estimate its value. This can be the case if one wants to include evidence from past studies or a theoretical derivation; e.g., when using a binomial model. S-Plus has an option to fix this residual error to a constant, in contrast to R. For convenience, the nlme package was customized to offer this option as well. In this paper, we derived the log-likelihoods for the mixed models using a fixed residual error. By using some well-known examples from mixed models, we demonstrated the equivalence of R and S-Plus with respect to the estimates. The updated package has been accepted by the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) team and will be available at the CRAN website.",

With EMSaov, a user can easily find the F statistic denominator and can determine how to analyze the data when using a special experimental design. We also develop a web application with a GUI interface using the shiny package in R . We expect that our application can contribute to the efficient and easy analysis of experimental data.",

    "description": "In clinical practice, it is very useful to select an optimal cutpoint in the scale of a continuous biomarker or diagnostic test for classifying individuals as healthy or diseased. Several methods for choosing optimal cutpoints have been presented in the literature, depending on the ultimate goal. One of these methods, the generalized symmetry point, recently introduced, generalizes the symmetry point by incorporating the misclassification costs. Two statistical approaches have been proposed in the literature for estimating this optimal cutpoint and its associated sensitivity and specificity measures, a parametric method based on the generalized pivotal quantity and a nonparametric method based on empirical likelihood. In this paper, we introduce GsymPoint, an R package that implements these methods in a user-friendly environment, allowing the end-user to calculate the generalized symmetry point depending on the levels of certain categorical covariates. The practical use of this package is illustrated using three real biomedical datasets.",

    "description": "This paper introduces the R package that implements the Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm, which was developed for univariate time series forecasting. This algorithm has been successfully applied to many different fields. The PSF algorithm consists of two major parts: clustering and prediction. The clustering part includes selection of the optimum number of clusters. It labels time series data with reference to such clusters. The prediction part includes functions like optimum window size selection for specific patterns and prediction of future values with reference to past pattern sequences. The PSF package consists of various functions to implement the PSF algorithm. It also contains a function which automates all other functions to obtain optimized prediction results. The aim of this package is to promote the PSF algorithm and to ease its usage with minimum efforts. This paper describes all the functions in the PSF package with their syntax. It also provides a simple example. Finally, the usefulness of this package is discussed by comparing it to auto.arima and ets, well-known time series forecasting functions available on CRAN repository.",

Unfortunately, it can be challenging to understand the results of such models and explain them to management. Partial dependence plots offer a simple solution. Partial dependence plots are low dimensional graphical renderings of the prediction function so that the relationship between the outcome and predictors of interest can be more easily understood. These plots are especially useful in explaining the output from black box models. In this paper, we introduce pdp, a general R package for constructing partial dependence plots.",

    "description": "Weighted effect coding refers to a specific coding matrix to include factor variables in generalised linear regression models. With weighted effect coding, the effect for each category represents the deviation of that category from the weighted mean (which corresponds to the sample mean). This technique has particularly attractive properties when analysing observational data, that commonly are unbalanced. The wec package is introduced, that provides functions to apply weighted effect coding to factor variables, and to interactions between (a.) a factor variable and a continuous variable and between (b.) two factor variables.",

    "description": "Data-only packages offer a way to provide extended functionality for other R users. However, such packages can be large enough to exceed the package size limit (5 megabytes) for the Comprehen sive R Archive Network (CRAN). As an alternative, large data packages can be posted to additional repostiories beyond CRAN itself in a way that allows smaller code packages on CRAN to access and use the data. The drat package facilitates creation and use of such alternative repositories and makes it particularly simple to host them via GitHub. CRAN packages can draw on packages posted to drat repositories through the use of the ‘Additonal_repositories’ field in the DESCRIPTION file. This paper describes how R users can create a suite of coordinated packages, in which larger data packages are hosted in an alternative repository created with drat, while a smaller code package that interacts with this data is created that can be submitted to CRAN.",

The rnrfa package provides a set of functions to programmatically access, filter, and visualize NRFA data using simple R syntax. This paper describes the structure of the rnrfa package, including examples using the main functions gdf() and cmr() for flow and rainfall data, respectively. Visualization examples are also provided with a shiny web application and functions provided in the package. Although this package is regional specific, the general framework and structure could be applied to similar databases.",

Within the database community there exist many different solutions for the specification and calculation of Pareto frontiers, also called Skyline queries in the database context. Slight generalizations like the combination of the Pareto operator with the lexicographical order have been established under the term database preferences. In this paper we present the rPref package which allows to efficiently deal with these concepts within R. With its help, database preferences can be specified in a very similar way as in a state-of-the-art database management system. Our package provides algorithms for an efficient calculation of the Pareto-optimal set and further functionalities for visualizing and analyzing the induced preference order.",

    "description": "The WeDiBaDis package provides a user friendly environment to perform discriminant analysis (supervised classification). WeDiBaDis is an easy to use package addressed to the biological and medical communities, and in general, to researchers interested in applied studies. It can be suitable when the user is interested in the problem of constructing a discriminant rule on the basis of distances between a relatively small number of instances or units of known unbalanced-class membership measured on many (possibly thousands) features of any type. This is a current situation when analyzing genetic biomedical data. This discriminant rule can then be used both, as a means of explaining differences among classes, but also in the important task of assigning the class membership for new unlabeled units. Our package implements two discriminant analysis procedures in an R environment: the well-known distance-based discriminant analysis (DB-discriminant) and a weighted distance-based discriminant (WDB-discriminant), a novel classifier rule that we introduce. This new procedure is based on an improvement of the DB rule taking into account the statistical depth of the units. This article presents both classifying procedures and describes the implementation of each in detail. We illustrate the use of the package using an ecological and a genetic experimental example. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the new proposed procedure (WDB), as compared with DB. This comparison is carried out using thirty-eight, high-dimensional, class-unbalanced, cancer data sets, three of which include clinical features.",

The condSURV package provides three different approaches all based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In one of these approaches these quantities are estimated conditionally on current or past covariate measures. Illustration of the software usage is included using real data.",

There are a number of analysis tools which are used to guide researchers through their analysis. Some of these tools are commercial and provide basic methods for ROC curve analysis while others offer advanced analysis techniques and a command-based user interface, such as the R environment. The R environmentg includes comprehensive tools for ROC curve analysis; however, using a command-based interface might be challenging and time consuming when a quick evaluation is desired; especially for non-R users, physicians etc. Hence, a quick, comprehensive, free and easy-to-use analysis tool is required. For this purpose, we developed a user-friendly web tool based on the R language. This tool provides ROC statistics, graphical tools, optimal cutpoint calculation, comparison of several markers, and sample size estimation to support researchers in their decisions without writing R codes. easyROC can be used via any device with an internet connection independently of the operating system. The web interface of easyROC is constructed with the R package shiny. This tool is freely available through www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC.",

In recent years, an increasing number of research projects in social and interdisciplinary sciences, including fields like innovation studies, scientometrics, economics, and network science have emphasized the role of diversification and sophistication of socioeconomic systems. However, so far no dedicated package exists that covers the needs of these emerging fields and interdisciplinary teams. Most packages about diversity tend to be created according to the demands and terminology of particular areas of natural and biological sciences. The package diverse uses interdisciplinary concepts of diversity—like variety, disparity and balance— as well as ubiquity and revealed comparative advantages, that are relevant to many fields of science, but are in particular useful for interdisciplinary research on diversity in socioeconomic systems. The package diverse provides a toolkit for social scientists, interdisciplinary researcher, and beginners in ecology to (i) import data, (ii) calculate different data transformations and normalization like revealed comparative advantages, (iii) calculate different diversity measures, and (iv) connect diverse to other specialized R packages on similarity measures, data visualization techniques, and statistical significance tests. The comprehensiveness of the package, from matrix import and transformations options, over similarity and diversity measures, to data visualization methods, makes it a useful package to explore different dimensions of diversity in complex systems.",

The package focuses on associated kernel methods appropriate for continuous (bounded, positive) or discrete (count, categorical) data often found in applied settings. Furthermore, optimal bandwidths are selected by cross-validation for any associated kernel and by Bayesian methods for the binomial kernel. Other Bayesian methods for selecting bandwidths with other associated kernels will complete this package in its future versions; particularly, a Bayesian adaptive method for gamma kernel estimation of density functions is developed. Some practical and theoretical aspects of the normalizing constant in both density and probability mass functions estimations are given.",

    "description": "The crop water requirement is a key factor in the agricultural process. It is usually estimated throughout actual evapotranspiration (ETa ). This parameter is the key to develop irrigation strategies, to improve water use efficiency and to understand hydrological, climatic, and ecosystem processes. Currently, it is calculated with classical methods, which are difficult to extrapolate, or with land surface energy balance models (LSEB), such as METRIC and SEBAL, which are based on remote sensing data. This paper describes water, an open implementation of LSEB. The package provides several functions to estimate the parameters of the LSEB equation from satellite data and proposes a new object class to handle weather station data. One of the critical steps in METRIC is the selection of “cold” and “hot” pixels, which water solves with an automatic method. The water package can process a batch of satellite images and integrates most of the already published sub-models for METRIC. Although water implements METRIC, it will be expandable to SEBAL and others in the near future. Finally, two different procedures are demonstrated using data that is included in water package.",

This problem results in unstable estimates of regression coefficients and causes some serious problems in validation and interpretation of the model. Different diagnostic measures are used to detect multicollinearity among regressors. Many statistical software and R packages provide few diagnostic measures for the judgment of multicollinearity. Most widely used diagnostic measures in these software are: coefficient of determination (R2 ), variance inflation factor/tolerance limit (VIF/TOL), eigenvalues, condition number (CN) and condition index (CI) etc. In this manuscript, we present an R package, mctest, that computes popular and widely used multicollinearity diagnostic measures. The package also indicates which regressors may be the reason of collinearity among regressors.",

It provides a flexible interface for defining models for the risk given treatment and the surrogate, the models for integration over the missing counterfactual surrogate responses, and the estimation methods. Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score can be used for estimation, and the bootstrap for inference. A variety of post-estimation methods are provided, including print, summary, plot, and testing. We summarize the main statistical methods that are implemented in the package and illustrate its use from the perspective of a novice R user.",

    "description": "Models of cancer progression provide insights on the order of accumulation of genetic alterations during cancer development. Algorithms to infer such models from the currently available mutational profiles collected from different cancer patients (cross-sectional data) have been defined in the literature since late the 90s. These algorithms differ in the way they extract a graphical model of the events modelling the progression, e.g., somatic mutations or copy-number alterations. TRONCO is an R package for TRanslational ONcology which provides a series of functions to assist the user in the analysis of cross-sectional genomic data and, in particular, it implements algorithms that aim to model cancer progression by means of the notion of selective advantage. These algorithms are proved to outperform the current state-of-the-art in the inference of cancer progression models. TRONCO also provides functionalities to load input cross-sectional data, set up the execution of the algorithms, assess the statistical confidence in the results, and visualize the models.

These include the classical approach to (symmetrical) correspondence analysis, singly ordered correspondence analysis, doubly ordered correspondence analysis, non symmetrical correspondence analysis, singly ordered non symmetrical correspondence analysis and doubly ordered non symmetrical correspondence analysis. The code provides the flexibility for constructing either a classical correspondence plot or a biplot graphical display. It also allows the user to consider other important features that allow to assess the reliability of the graphical representations, such as the inclusion of algebraically derived elliptical confidence regions. This paper provides R functions that elaborates more fully on the code presented in Beh and Lombardo (2014).",

A large body of knowledge on pathways is organized in public databases such as the KEGG, Reactome, or in more specialized repositories, the Atlas of Cancer Signaling Network (ACSN) being an example. All these open biological databases facilitate analyses, improving our understanding of cellular systems. We hereby describe ACSNMineR for calculation of enrichment or depletion of lists of genes of interest in biological pathways. ACSNMineR integrates ACSN molecular pathways gene sets, but can use any gene set encoded as a GMT file, for instance sets of genes available in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). We also present RNaviCell, that can be used in conjunction with ACSNMineR to visualize different data types on web-based, interactive ACSN maps. We illustrate the functionalities of the two packages with biological data taken from large-scale cancer datasets.",

    "description": "Social scientists and statisticians often use aggregate data to predict individual-level behavior because the latter are not always available. Various statistical techniques have been developed to make inferences from one level (e.g., precinct) to another level (e.g., individual voter) that minimize errors associated with ecological inference. While ecological inference has been shown to be highly problematic in a wide array of scientific fields, many political scientists and analysis employ the techniques when studying voting patterns. Indeed, federal voting rights lawsuits now require such an analysis, yet expert reports are not consistent in which type of ecological inference is used. This is especially the case in the analysis of racially polarized voting when there are multiple candidates and multiple racial groups. The eiCompare package was developed to easily assess two of the more common ecological inference methods: EI and EI:R×C. The package facilitates a seamless comparison between these methods so that scholars and legal practitioners can easily assess the two methods and whether they produce similar or disparate findings.",

    "title": "Two-Tier Latent Class IRT Models in R",
    "description": "In analyzing data deriving from the administration of a questionnaire to a group of individu als, Item Response Theory (IRT) models provide a flexible framework to account for several aspects involved in the response process, such as the existence of multiple latent traits. In this paper, we focus on a class of semi-parametric multidimensional IRT models, in which these traits are represented through one or more discrete latent variables; these models allow us to cluster individuals into homo geneous latent classes and, at the same time, to properly study item characteristics. In particular, we follow a within-item multidimensional formulation similar to that adopted in the two-tier models, with each item measuring one or two latent traits. The proposed class of models may be estimated through the package MLCIRTwithin, whose functioning is illustrated in this paper with examples based on data about quality-of-life measurement and about the propensity to commit a crime.",

    "description": "In this article the package High-dimensional Metrics hdm is introduced. It is a collection of statistical methods for estimation and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. It focuses on providing confidence intervals and significance testing for (possibly many) low-dimensional subcomponents of the high-dimensional parameter vector. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for regression coefficients on target variables (e.g., treatment or policy variable) in a high-dimensional approximately sparse regression model, for average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect for the treated (ATET), as well for extensions of these param eters to the endogenous setting are provided. Theory grounded, data-driven methods for selecting the penalization parameter in Lasso regressions under heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian errors are implemented. Moreover, joint/ simultaneous confidence intervals for regression coefficients of a high-dimensional sparse regression are implemented. Data sets which have been used in the literature and might be useful for classroom demonstration and for testing new estimators are included.",

    "description": "Subgroup discovery is a data mining task halfway between descriptive and predictive data mining. Nowadays it is very relevant for researchers due to the fact that the knowledge extracted is simple and interesting. For this task, evolutionary fuzzy systems are well suited algorithms because they can find a good trade-off between multiple objectives in large search spaces. In fact, this paper presents the SDEFSR package, which contains all the evolutionary fuzzy systems for subgroup discovery presented throughout the literature. It is a package without dependencies on other software, providing functions with recommended default parameters. In addition, it brings a graphical user interface to avoid the user having to know all the parameters of the algorithms.",

For this reason, a vast portfolio of time series distance measures has been published in the past few years. In this paper, the TSdist package is presented, a complete tool which provides a unified framework to calculate the largest variety of time series dissimilarity measures available in R at the moment, to the best of our knowledge. The package implements some popular distance measures which were not previously available in R, and moreover, it also provides wrappers for measures already included in other R packages. Additionally, the application of these distance measures to clustering and classification tasks is also supported in TSdist, directly enabling the evaluation and comparison of their performance within these two frameworks.",

    "description": "Reuse of controls from nested case-control designs can increase efficiency in many situations, for instance with competing risks or in other multiple endpoints situations. The matching between cases and controls must be broken when controls are to be used for other endpoints. A weighted analysis can then be performed to take care of the biased sampling from the cohort. We present the R package multipleNCC for reuse of controls in nested case-control studies by inverse probability weighting of the partial likelihood. The package handles right-censored, left-truncated and additionally matched data, and varying numbers of sampled controls and the whole analysis is carried out using one simple command. Four weight estimators are presented and variance estimation is explained. The package is illustrated by analyzing health survey data from three counties in Norway for two causes of death: cardiovascular disease and death from alcohol abuse, liver disease, and accidents and violence. The data set is included in the package.",

We develop fast, reliable basic probability functions (dinvgauss, pinvgauss, qinvgauss and rinvgauss) for the IGD that work for all possible parameter values and which achieve close to full machine accuracy. The most challenging task is to compute quantiles for given cumulative probabilities and we develop a simple but elegant mathematical solution to this problem. We show that Newton’s method for finding the quantiles of a IGD always converges monotonically when started from the mode of the distribution. Simple Taylor series expansions are used to improve accuracy on the log-scale. The IGD probability functions provide the same options and obey the same conventions as do probability functions provided in the stats package.",

Analysis of gender disparities in science based on such methods are published in the most prestigious journals, although they could be improved by choosing the most suited prediction method with optimal parameters and performing validation studies using the best data source for a given purpose. There is also a need to monitor and report how well a given prediction method works in comparison to others.

For either meta-analysis or meta-regression it is possible to fit one of three models: standard normal random effect, t-distribution random effect or mixture of normal random effects. The latter two models allow for robustness by allowing for a random effect distribution with heavier tails than the normal distribution, and for both robust models the presence of outliers may be tested using the parametric bootstrap. For the mixture of normal random effects model the outlier studies may be identified through their posterior probability of membership in the outlier component of the mixture. Plots allow the results of the different models to be compared. The package is demonstrated on three examples: a meta-analysis with no outliers, a meta-analysis with an outlier and a meta-regression with an outlier.",

The target variable of the application is the daily mean PM10 concentration measured at rural air quality monitoring stations across Germany in 2005. R code for variogram fitting and interpolation is presented in this paper to illustrate the workflow of spatio-temporal interpolation using gstat. We conclude that the system works properly and that the extension of gstat facilitates and eases spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and prediction for R users.",

    "title": "R Packages to Aid in Handling Web Access Logs",
    "description": "Web access logs contain information on HTTP(S) requests and form a key part of both industry and academic explorations of human behaviour on the internet. But the preparation (reading, parsing and manipulation) of that data is just unique enough to make generalized tools unfit for the task, both in programming time and processing time which are compounded when dealing with large data sets common with web access logs. In this paper we explain and demonstrate a series of packages designed to efficiently read in, parse and munge access log data, allowing researchers to handle URLs and IP addresses easily. These packages are substantially faster than existing R methods from a 3-500% speedup for file reading to a 57,000% speedup in URL parsing.",

GMDH algorithms are utilized for a variety of purposes, examples include identification of physical laws, the extrapolation of physical fields, pattern recognition, clustering, the approximation of multidimensional processes, forecasting without models, etc. In this study, the R package GMDH is presented to make short term forecasting through GMDH-type neural network algorithms. The GMDH package has options to use different transfer functions (sigmoid, radial basis, polynomial, and tangent functions) simultaneously or separately. Data on cancer death rate of Pennsylvania from 1930 to 2000 are used to illustrate the features of the GMDH package. The results based on ARIMA models and exponential smoothing methods are included for comparison.",

    "description": "Interest in social network analysis has exploded in the past few years, partly thanks to the advancements in statistical methods and computing for network analysis. A wide range of the methods for network analysis is already covered by existent R packages. However, no comprehensive packages are available to calculate group centrality scores and to identify key players (i.e., those players who constitute the most central group) in a network. These functionalities are important because, for example, many social and health interventions rely on key players to facilitate the intervention. Identifying key players is challenging because players who are individually the most central are not necessarily the most central as a group due to redundancy in their connections. In this paper we develop methods and tools for computing group centrality scores and for identifying key players in social networks. We illustrate the methods using both simulated and empirical examples. The package keyplayer providing the presented methods is available from Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

    "description": "The general clustering algorithms do not guarantee optimality because of the hardness of the problem. Polynomial-time methods can find the clustering corresponding to the exact optimum only in special cases. For example, the dynamic programming algorithm can solve the one-dimensional clustering problem, i.e., when the items to be clustered can be characterised by only one scalar number. Optimal one-dimensional clustering is provided by package Ckmeans.1d.dp in R. The paper shows a possible generalisation of the method implemented in this package to multidimensional data: the dynamic programming method can be applied to find the optimum clustering of vectors when only subsequent items may form a cluster. Sequential data are common in various fields including telecommunication, bioinformatics, marketing, transportation etc. The proposed algorithm can determine the optima for a range of cluster numbers in order to support the case when the number of clusters is not known in advance.",

Though many clustering evaluation techniques have been developed to solve this problem, the recently developed algorithm Progeny Clustering is a much faster alternative and one that is relevant to biomedical applications. In this paper, we introduce an R package progenyClust that implements and extends the original Progeny Clustering algorithm for evaluating clustering stability and identifying the optimal cluster number. We illustrate its applicability using two examples: a simulated test dataset for proof-of-concept, and a cell imaging dataset for demonstrating its application potential in biomedical research. The progenyClust package is versatile in that it offers great flexibility for picking methods and tuning parameters. In addition, the default parameter setting as well as the plot and summary methods offered in the package make the application of Progeny Clustering straightforward and coherent.",

    "description": "In recent years, the cost of DNA sequencing has decreased at a rate that has outpaced improvements in memory capacity. It is now common to collect or have access to many gigabytes of biological sequences. This has created an urgent need for approaches that analyze sequences in subsets without requiring all of the sequences to be loaded into memory at one time. It has also opened opportunities to improve the organization and accessibility of information acquired in sequencing projects. The DECIPHER package offers solutions to these problems by assisting in the curation of large sets of biological sequences stored in compressed format inside a database. This approach has many practical advantages over standard bioinformatics workflows, and enables large analyses that would otherwise be prohibitively time consuming.",

To this end, it is necessary to determine the best subset of q (q ≤ p) predictors which will establish the model with the best prediction capacity. FWDselect package introduces a new forward stepwise based selection procedure to select the best model in different regression frameworks (parametric or nonparametric). The developed methodology, which can be equally applied to linear models, generalized linear models or generalized additive models, aims to introduce solutions to the following two topics: i) selection of the best combination of q variables by using a step-by-step method; and, perhaps, most importantly, ii) search for the number of covariates to be included in the model based on bootstrap resampling techniques. The software is illustrated using real and simulated data.",

This article describes hiddenf, an R package that enables users to quantify and characterize a certain form of interaction in two-factor layouts. When effects of one factor (a) fall into two groups depending on the level of another factor, and (b) are constant within these groups, the interaction pattern is deemed \"hidden additivity\" because within groups, the effects of the two factors are additive, while between groups the factors are allowed to interact. The hiddenf software can be used to estimate, test, and report an appropriate factorial effects model corresponding to hidden additivity, which is intermediate between the unavailable full factorial model and the overly-simplistic additive model. Further, the software also conducts five statistical tests for interaction proposed between 1949 and 2014. A collection of 17 datasets is used for illustration.",

In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can benefit from our implementation of a series of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of similarity metrics.",

    "title": "Generalized Hermite Distribution Modelling with the R Package hermite",
    "description": "The Generalized Hermite distribution (and the Hermite distribution as a particular case) is often used for fitting count data in the presence of overdispersion or multimodality. Despite this, to our knowledge, no standard software packages have implemented specific functions to compute basic probabilities and make simple statistical inference based on these distributions. We present here a set of computational tools that allows the user to face these difficulties by modelling with the Generalized Hermite distribution using the R package hermite. The package can also be used to generate random deviates from a Generalized Hermite distribution and to use basic functions to compute probabilities (density, cumulative density and quantile functions are available), to estimate parameters using the maximum likelihood method and to perform the likelihood ratio test for Poisson assumption against a Generalized Hermite alternative. In order to improve the density and quantile functions performance when the parameters are large, Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions have been used. Hermite regression is also a useful tool for modeling inflated count data, so its inclusion to a commonly used software like R will make this tool available to a wide range of potential users. Some examples of usage in several fields of application are also given.",

    "description": "The rivr package provides a computational toolset for simulating steady and unsteady one dimensional flows in open channels. It is designed primarily for use by instructors of undergraduate and graduate-level open-channel hydrodynamics courses in such diverse fields as river engineering, physical geography and geophysics. The governing equations used to describe open-channel flows are briefly presented, followed by example applications. These include the computation of gradually varied flows and two examples of unsteady flows in channels—namely, the tracking of the evolution of a flood wave in a channel and the prediction of extreme variation in the water-surface profile that results when a sluice gate is abruptly closed. Model results for the unsteady flow examples are validated against standard benchmarks. The article concludes with a discussion of potential modifications and extensions to the package.",

    "title": "scmamp: Statistical Comparison of Multiple Algorithms in Multiple Problems",
    "description": "Comparing the results obtained by two or more algorithms in a set of problems is a central task in areas such as machine learning or optimization. Drawing conclusions from these comparisons may require the use of statistical tools such as hypothesis testing. There are some interesting papers that cover this topic. In this manuscript we present scmamp, an R package aimed at being a tool that simplifies the whole process of analyzing the results obtained when comparing algorithms, from loading the data to the production of plots and tables. Comparing the performance of different algorithms is an essential step in many research and practical computational works. When new algorithms are proposed, they have to be compared with the state of the art. Similarly, when an algorithm is used for a particular problem, its performance with different sets of parameters has to be compared, in order to tune them for the best results. When the differences are very clear (e.g., when an algorithm is the best in all the problems used in the comparison), the direct comparison of the results may be enough. However, this is an unusual situation and, thus, in most situations a direct comparison may be misleading and not enough to draw sound conclusions; in those cases, the statistical assessment of the results is advisable. The statistical comparison of algorithms in the context of machine learning has been covered in several papers. In particular, the tools implemented in this package are those presented in Demšar (2006); García and Herrera (2008); García et al. (2010). Another good review that covers, among other aspects, the statistical assessment of the results in the context of supervised classification can be found in Santafé et al. (2015).",

    "description": "This paper introduces the hypergeo package of R routines for numerical calculation of hypergeometric functions. The package is focussed on efficient and accurate evaluation of the Gauss hypergeometric function over the whole of the complex plane within the constraints of fixed-precision arithmetic. The hypergeometric series is convergent only within the unit circle, so analytic continuation must be used to define the function outside the unit circle. This short document outlines the numerical and conceptual methods used in the package; and justifies the package philosophy, which is to maintain transparent and verifiable links between the software and Abramowitz and Stegun (1965). Most of the package functionality is accessed via the single function hypergeo(), which dispatches to one of several methods depending on the value of its arguments. The package is demonstrated in the context of game theory.",

    "description": "Code analysis tools are crucial to understand program behavior. Profile tools use the results of time measurements in the execution of a program to gain this understanding and thus help in the optimization of the code. In this paper, we review the different available packages to profile R code and show the advantages and disadvantages of each of them. In additon, we present GUIProfiler, a package that fulfills some unmet needs. Package GUIProfiler generates an HTML report with the timing for each code line and the relationships between different functions. This package mimics the behavior of the MATLAB profiler. The HTML report includes information on the time spent on each of the lines of the profiled code (the slowest code is highlighted). If the package is used within the RStudio environment, the user can navigate across the bottlenecks in the code and open the editor to modify the lines of code where more time is spent. It is also possible to edit the code using Notepad++ (a free editor for Windows) by simply clicking on the corresponding line. The graphical user interface makes it easy to identify the specific lines which slow down the code. The integration in RStudio and the generation of an HTML report makes GUIProfiler a very convenient tool to perform code optimization.",

The first is a subset of important variables including some redundancy which can be relevant for interpretation, and the second one is a smaller subset corresponding to a model trying to avoid redundancy focusing more closely on the prediction objective. The two-stage strategy is based on a preliminary ranking of the explanatory variables using the random forests permutation-based score of importance and proceeds using a stepwise forward strategy for variable introduction. The two proposals can be obtained automatically using data-driven default values, good enough to provide interesting results, but strategy can also be tuned by the user. The algorithm is illustrated on a simulated example and its applications to real datasets are presented.",

We propose the use of several R packages to generate interactive surveys that are specifically well suited for validating social network analyses. Using our web-based survey application, we were able to validate the results of applying community-detection algorithms to infer the organizational structure of software developers contributing to open-source projects.",

    "description": "Along with increased complexity of the models used for scientific activities and engineering come diverse and greater uncertainties. Today, effectively quantifying the uncertainties contained in a model appears to be more important than ever. Scientific fellows know how serious it is to calibrate their model in a robust way, and decision-makers describe how critical it is to keep the best effort to reduce the uncertainties about the model. Effectively accessing the uncertainties about the model requires mastering all the tasks involved in the numerical experiments, from optimizing the experimental design to managing the very time consuming aspect of model simulation and choosing the adequate indicators and analysis methods. In this paper, we present an open framework for organizing the complexity associated with numerical model simulation and analyses. Named mtk (Mexico Toolkit), the developed system aims at providing practitioners from different disciplines with a systematic and easy way to compare and to find the best method to effectively uncover and quantify the uncertainties contained in the model and further to evaluate their impact on the performance of the model. Such requirements imply that the system must be generic, universal, homogeneous, and extensible. This paper discusses such an implementation using the R scientific computing platform and demonstrates its functionalities with examples from agricultural modeling. The package mtk is of general purpose and easy to extend. Numerous methods are already available in the actual release version, including Fast, Sobol, Morris, Basic Monte-Carlo, Regression, LHS (Latin Hypercube Sampling), PLMM (Polynomial Linear metamodel). Most of them are compiled from available R packages with extension tools delivered by package mtk.",

    "description": "A simple temporal point process (SPP) is an important class of time series, where the sample realization of the process is solely composed of the times at which events occur. Particular examples of point process data are neuronal spike patterns or spike trains, and a large number of distance and similarity metrics for those data have been proposed. A marked point process (MPP) is an extension of a simple temporal point process, in which a certain vector valued mark is associated with each of the temporal points in the SPP. Analyses of MPPs are of practical importance because instances of MPPs include recordings of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes. In this paper, we introduce the R package mmpp, which implements a number of distance and similarity metrics for SPPs, and also extends those metrics for dealing with MPPs.",

    "description": "Most classification algorithms deal with datasets which have a set of input features, the variables to be used as predictors, and only one output class, the variable to be predicted. However, in late years many scenarios in which the classifier has to work with several outputs have come to life. Automatic labeling of text documents, image annotation or protein classification are among them. Multilabel datasets are the product of these new needs, and they have many specific traits. The mldr package allows the user to load datasets of this kind, obtain their characteristics, produce specialized plots, and manipulate them. The goal is to provide the exploratory tools needed to analyze multilabel datasets, as well as the transformation and manipulation functions that will make possible to apply binary and multiclass classification models to this data or the development of new multilabel classifiers. Thanks to its integrated user interface, the exploratory functions will be available even to non-specialized R users.",

These dissimilarities arise from a set of classification or regression trees, one with each variable in the data acting in turn as a the response, and all others as predictors. This use of trees produces dissim ilarities that are insensitive to scaling, benefit from automatic variable selection, and appear to perform well. The software allows a number of options to be set, affecting the set of objects returned in the call; the user can also specify a clustering algorithm and, optionally, return only the clustering vector. The package can also generate a numeric data set whose inter-point distances relate to the treeClust ones; such a numeric data set can be much smaller than the vector of inter-point dissimilarities, a useful feature in big data sets.",

    "description": "We present a new version (> 2.0) of the hglm package for fitting hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs) with spatially correlated random effects. CAR() and SAR() families for con ditional and simultaneous autoregressive random effects were implemented. Eigen decomposition of the matrix describing the spatial structure (e.g., the neighborhood matrix) was used to transform the CAR/SAR random effects into an independent, but heteroscedastic, Gaussian random effect. A linear predictor is fitted for the random effect variance to estimate the parameters in the CAR and SAR models. This gives a computationally efficient algorithm for moderately sized problems.",

    "description": "The problem of comparing a new solution method against existing ones to find statistically significant differences arises very often in sciences and engineering. When the problem instance being solved is defined by several parameters, assessing a number of methods with respect to many problem configurations simultaneously becomes a hard task. Some visualization technique is required for presenting a large number of statistical significance results in an easily interpretable way. Here we review an existing color-based approach called Statistical Ranking Color Scheme (SRCS) for displaying the results of multiple pairwise statistical comparisons between several methods assessed separately on a number of problem configurations. We introduce an R package implementing SRCS, which performs all the pairwise statistical tests from user data and generates customizable plots. We demonstrate its applicability on two examples from the areas of dynamic optimization and machine learning, in which several algorithms are compared on many problem instances, each defined by a combination of parameters.",

    "description": "Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a popular family of algorithms which perform approximate parameter inference when numerical evaluation of the likelihood function is not possible but data can be simulated from the model. They return a sample of parameter values which produce simulations close to the observed dataset. A standard approach is to reduce the simulated and observed datasets to vectors of summary statistics and accept when the difference between these is below a specified threshold. ABC can also be adapted to perform model choice. In this article, we present a new software package for R, abctools which provides methods for tuning ABC algorithms. This includes recent dimension reduction algorithms to tune the choice of summary statistics, and coverage methods to tune the choice of threshold. We provide several illustrations of these routines on applications taken from the ABC literature.",

    "title": "zoib: An R Package for Bayesian Inference for Beta Regression and Zero/One Inflated Beta Regression",
    "description": "The beta distribution is a versatile function that accommodates a broad range of probability distribution shapes. Beta regression based on the beta distribution can be used to model a response variable y that takes values in open unit interval (0, 1). Zero/one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression models can be applied when y takes values from closed unit interval [0, 1]. The ZOIB model is based a piecewise distribution that accounts for the probability mass at 0 and 1, in addition to the probability density within (0, 1). This paper introduces an R package – zoib that provides Bayesian inferences for a class of ZOIB models. The statistical methodology underlying the zoib package is discussed, the functions covered by the package are outlined, and the usage of the package is illustrated with three examples of different data and model types. The package is comprehensive and versatile in that it can model data with or without inflation at 0 or 1, accommodate clustered and correlated data via latent variables, perform penalized regression as needed, and allow for model comparison via the computation of the DIC criterion.",

Moreover, quantitative isother mal amplification (qIA) methods have become more prominent in life sciences and point-of-care diagnostics. Additionally, the analysis of melting data is essential during many experiments. Several software packages have been developed for the analysis of such datasets. In most cases, the software is either distributed as closed source software or as monolithic block with little freedom to perform highly customized analysis procedures. We argue, among others, that R is an excellent foundation for reproducible and transparent data analysis in a highly customizable cross-platform environment. However, for novices it is often challenging to master R or learn capabilities of the vast number of packages available. In the paper, we describe exemplary workflows for the analysis of qPCR, qIA or dPCR experiments including the analysis of melting curve data. Our analysis relies entirely on R packages available from public repositories. Additionally, we provide information related to standardized and reproducible research.",

It aims to establish a typology of the external variables and a typology of the events from their mutual relationships. In order to do so, the influence of external variables on the lexical choices is untangled cancelling the associations among them, and to avoid the instability issued from multicollinearity, they are substituted by their principal components. The CaGalt function, implemented in the FactoMineR package, provides numerous numerical and graphical outputs. Confidence ellipses are also provided to validate and improve the representation of words and variables.

These kind of graphics are well-known in literature and are considered as simple, intense and illustrative graphs that are small enough to fit in a single line. Thus, they can easily enrich tables and texts with additional information in a comprehensive visual way. The R package sparkTable uses a clean S4 class design and provides methods to create different types of sparkgraphs that can be used in websites, presentations and documents. We also implemented an easy way for non-experts to create highly complex tables. In this case, graphical parameters can be interactively changed, variables can be sorted, graphs can be added and removed in an interactive manner. Thereby it is possible to produce custom-tailored graphical tables – standard tables that are enriched with graphs – that can be displayed in a browser and exported to various formats.",

    "description": "Data from complex survey designs require special consideration with regard to estimation of finite population parameters and corresponding variance estimation procedures, as a consequence of significant departures from the simple random sampling assumption. In the past decade a number of statistical software packages have been developed to facilitate the analysis of complex survey data. All these statistical software packages are able to treat samples selected from one sampling frame containing all population units. Dual frame surveys are very useful when it is not possible to guarantee a complete coverage of the target population and may result in considerable cost savings over a single frame design with comparable precision. There are several estimators available in the statistical literature but no existing software covers dual frame estimation procedures. This gap is now filled by package Frames2. In this paper we highlight the main features of the package. The package includes the main estimators in dual frame surveys and also provides interval confidence estimation.",

However, it is rarely shown in research papers due to the difficulties in nonparametric estimation. We developed the bshazard package to facilitate the computation of a nonparametric estimate of the hazard function, with data-driven smoothing. The method accounts for left truncation, right censoring and possible covariates. B-splines are used to estimate the shape of the hazard within the generalized linear mixed models framework. Smoothness is controlled by imposing an autoregressive structure on the baseline hazard coefficients. This perspective allows an ’automatic’ smoothing by avoiding the need to choose the smoothing parameter, which is estimated from the data as a dispersion parameter. A simulation study demonstrates the capability of our software and an application to estimate the hazard of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in Swedish population data shows its potential.",

The functions are flexible, computationally efficient, and compatible with uniaxial or triaxial data. The package nhanesaccel is specifically for processing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), years 2003–2006. Its primary function generates measures of PA volume, intensity, frequency, and patterns according to user-specified data processing methods. This function can process the NHANES 2003-2006 dataset in under one minute, which is a drastic improve ment over existing software.

    "description": "Assessing the assumption of multivariate normality is required by many parametric mul tivariate statistical methods, such as MANOVA, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, canonical correlation, etc. It is important to assess multivariate normality in order to proceed with such statistical methods. There are many analytical methods proposed for checking multivariate normality. However, deciding which method to use is a challenging process, since each method may give different results under certain conditions. Hence, we may say that there is no best method, which is valid under any condition, for normality checking. In addition to numerical results, it is very useful to use graphical methods to decide on multivariate normality. Combining the numerical results from several methods with graphical approaches can be useful and provide more reliable decisions. Here, we present an R package, MVN, to assess multivariate normality. It contains the three most widely used multivariate normality tests, including Mardia’s, Henze-Zirkler’s and Royston’s, and graphical approaches, including chi-square Q-Q, perspective and contour plots. It also includes two multivariate outlier detection methods, which are based on robust Mahalanobis distances. Moreover, this package offers functions to check the univariate normality of marginal distributions through both tests and plots. Furthermore, especially for non-R users, we provide a user-friendly web application of the package. This application is available at http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/MVN/.",

    "description": "Q is a methodology to explore the distinct subjective perspectives that exist within a group. It is used increasingly across disciplines. The methodology is semi-qualitative and the data are analysed using data reduction methods to discern the existing patterns of thought. This package is the first to perform Q analysis in R, and it provides many advantages to the existing software: namely, it is fully cross-platform, the algorithms can be transparently examined, it provides results in a clearly structured and tabulated form ready for further exploration and modelling, it produces a graphical summary of the results, and it generates a more concise report of the distinguishing and consensus statements. This paper introduces the methodology and explains how to use the package, its advantages as well as its limitations. I illustrate the main functions with a dataset on value patterns about democracy.",

    "description": "The R package gset calculates equivalence and futility boundaries based on the exact bivariate non-central t test statistics. It is the first R package that targets specifically at the group sequential test of equivalence hypotheses. The exact test approach adopted by gset neither assumes the large-sample normality of the test statistics nor ignores the contribution to the overall Type I error rate from rejecting one out of the two one-sided hypotheses under a null value. The features of gset include: error spending functions, computation of equivalence boundaries and futility boundaries, either binding or nonbinding, depiction of stagewise boundary plots, and operating characteristics of a given group sequential design including empirical Type I error rate, empirical power, expected sample size, and probability of stopping at an interim look due to equivalence or futility.",

The principal aim of this package is to implement SGoF-type multiple testing methods, known to be more powerful than the classical false discovery rate (FDR) and family-wise error rate (FWER) based methods in certain situations, particularly when the number of tests is large. This package includes Bi nomial and Conservative SGoF and the Bayesian and Beta-Binomial SGoF multiple testing procedures, which are adaptations of the original SGoF method to the Bayesian setting and to possibly correlated tests, respectively. The sgof package also implements the Benjamini-Hochberg and Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR controlling procedures. For each method the package provides (among other things) the number of rejected null hypotheses, estimation of the corresponding FDR, and the set of adjusted p values. Some automatic plots of interest are implemented too. Two real data examples are used to illustrate how sgof works.",

    "title": "Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis of fMRI Studies with R ",
    "description": "This paper outlines how to conduct a simple meta-analysis of neuroimaging foci of activation in R. In particular, the first part of this paper reviews the nature of fMRI data, and briefly overviews the existing packages that can be used to analyze fMRI data in R. The second part illustrates how to handle fMRI data by showing how to visualize the results of different neuroimaging studies in a so-called orthographic view, where the spatial distribution of the foci of activation from different fMRI studies can be inspected visually. Functional MRI (fMRI) is one of the most important and powerful tools of neuroscientific research. Although not as commonly used for fMRI analysis as some specific applications such as SPM (Friston et al., 2006), AFNI (Cox and Hyde, 1997), or FSL (Smith et al., 2004), R does provide several packages that can be employed in neuroimaging research. These packages deal with a variety of topics, ranging from reading and manipulating fMRI datasets, to implementing sophisticated statistical models. The goal of this paper is to provide a brief introduction to fMRI analysis, and the various R packages that can be used to carry it out. As an example, it will show how to use simple R commands to read fMRI images and plot results from previous studies, which can then be visually compared. This is a special form of meta-analysis, and a common way to compare results from the existing literature.",

    "description": "When modelling physical systems, analysts will frequently be confronted by differential equations which cannot be solved analytically. In this instance, numerical integration will usually be the only way forward. However, for autonomous systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in one or two dimensions, it is possible to employ an instructive qualitative analysis foregoing this requirement, using so-called phase plane methods. Moreover, this qualitative analysis can even prove to be highly useful for systems that can be solved analytically, or will be solved numerically anyway. The package phaseR allows the user to perform such phase plane analyses: determining the stability of any equilibrium points easily, and producing informative plots.",

Whereas a great deal of focus has been placed in the development of software tools that aid researchers develop simulations, similar focus has not been applied in the creation of tools that perform a rigorous statistical analysis of results generated through simulation: vital in understanding how these results offer an insight into the captured system. This encouraged us to develop spartan, a package of statistical techniques designed to assist researchers in understanding the relationship between their simulation and the real system. Previously we have described each technique within spartan in detail, with an accompanying immunology case study examining the development of lymphoid tissue. Here we provide a practical introduction to the package, demonstrating how each technique is run in R, to assist researchers in integrating this package alongside their chosen simulation platform.",

Typically, the leading principal components are used to understand the variation in the data or to reduce the dimension of the data for subsequent analysis. The remaining principal components are ignored since they explain little of the variation in the data. However, the space spanned by the low variation principal components may contain interesting structure, structure that PCA cannot find. Prinsimp is an R package that looks for interesting structure of low variability. “Interesting” is defined in terms of a simplicity measure. Looking for interpretable structure in a low variability space has particular importance in evolutionary biology, where such structure can signify the existence of a genetic constraint.",

It does this by recognising positional cues present in the hierarchical Table (which would normally be interpreted visually by the human brain) to decompose, then reconstruct the data into a LongForm dataframe. The article motivates the benefit of such a conversion with an example Table, followed by a short user manual, which includes a comparison between the simple one argument call to TableToLongForm, with code for an equivalent manual conversion. The article then explores the types of Tables the package can convert by providing a gallery of all recognised patterns.

The oligoMask package is an R/SQLite framework which can utilize publicly available genetic variants and works in conjunction with the oligo package to read in the expression data and remove microarray probes which are likely to impact a given microarray experiment prior to analysis.

    "description": "Comparing text strings in terms of distance functions is a common and fundamental task in many statistical text-processing applications. Thus far, string distance functionality has been somewhat scattered around R and its extension packages, leaving users with inconistent interfaces and encoding handling. The stringdist package was designed to offer a low-level interface to several popular string distance algorithms which have been re-implemented in C for this purpose. The package offers distances based on counting q-grams, edit-based distances, and some lesser known heuristic distance functions. Based on this functionality, the package also offers inexact matching equivalents of R’s native exact matching functions match and %in%.",

Traditional methods for analyzing the association between categorical variables are not appropriate with MRCVs due to the within-subject dependence among responses. We have developed the MRCV package as the first R package available to correctly analyze MRCV data. Statistical methods offered by our package include counterparts to traditional Pearson chi-square tests for independence and loglinear models, where bootstrap methods and Rao-Scott adjustments are relied on to obtain valid inferences. We demonstrate the primary functions within the package by analyzing data from a survey assessing the swine waste management practices of Kansas farmers.",

This article introduces the package sgr that can be used to perform fake data analysis according to the sample generation by replacement approach. The package includes functions for making simple inferences about discrete/ordinal fake data. The package allows to quantify uncertainty in inferences based on possible fake data as well as to study the implications of fake data for empirical results.",

This paper presents RStorm for the development and evaluation of streaming algorithms analogous to these production packages, but implemented fully in R. RStorm allows developers of streaming algorithms to quickly test, iterate, and evaluate various implementations of streaming algorithms. The paper provides both a canonical computer science example, the streaming word count, and examples of several statistical applications of RStorm.",

Among other things, PITCHf/x data can be used to recreate a baseball’s flight path from a pitcher’s hand to home plate. With pitchRx, one can easily create animations and interactive 3D scatterplots of the baseball’s flight path. PITCHf/x data is also commonly used to generate a static plot of baseball locations at the moment they cross home plate. These plots, sometimes called strike-zone plots, can also refer to a plot of event probabilities over the same region. pitchRx provides an easy and robust way to generate strike-zone plots using the ggplot2 package.",

There is a rich literature on parametric and non-parametric approaches for the analysis of interval-censored outcomes. A commonly used strategy is to use a proportional hazards (PH) model with the baseline hazard function parameterized. The proportional hazards assumption can be relaxed in stratified models by allowing the baseline hazard function to vary across strata defined by a subset of explanatory variables. In this paper, we describe and implement a new R package straweib, for fitting a stratified Weibull model appropriate for interval censored outcomes. We illustrate the R package straweib by analyzing data from a longitudinal oral health study on the timing of the emergence of permanent teeth in 4430 children.",

Ranking data are modeled by the Insertion Sorting Rank (ISR) model, which is a meaningful model parametrized by a central ranking and a dispersion parameter. A conditional independence assumption allows multivariate rankings to be taken into account, and clustering is performed by means of mixtures of multivariate ISR models. The parameters of the cluster (central rankings and dispersion parameters) help the practitioners to interpret the clustering. Moreover, the Rankcluster package provides an estimate of the missing ranking positions when rankings are partial. After an overview of the mixture of multivariate ISR models, the Rankcluster package is described and its use is illustrated through the analysis of two real datasets.",

The Beta-Skew-t-EGARCH model is a dynamic model of the scale or volatility of financial returns. The model is characterised by its robustness to jumps or outliers, and by its exponential specification of volatility. The latter enables richer dynamics, since parameters need not be restricted to be positive to ensure positivity of volatility. In addition, the model also allows for heavy tails and skewness in the conditional return (i.e. scaled return), and for leverage and a time-varying long-term component in the volatility specification. More generally, the model can be viewed as a model of the scale of the error in a dynamic regression.",

Both schools of thought are interested in the parsimonious presentation of sufficient information to enable readers to evaluate the significance of contrasts resulting from the inclusion of qualitative variables in GLMs. These comparisons also arise when trying to interpret multinomial models where one category of the dependent variable is omitted as a reference. While considerable advances have been made, opportunities remain to improve the presentation of this information, especially in graphical form.

    "description": "The multivariate normal and the multivariate t distributions belong to the most widely used multivariate distributions in statistics, quantitative risk management, and insurance. In contrast to the multivariate normal distribution, the parameterization of the multivariate t distribution does not correspond to its moments. This, paired with a non-standard implementation in the R package mvtnorm, provides traps for working with the multivariate t distribution. In this paper, common traps are clarified and corresponding recent changes to mvtnorm are presented.",

In practice, statistical analyses, including estimation, prediction and inference, are not reliable when data are unbalanced, of small size, contain outliers, or not normally distributed. It is fortunate that rank-based regression analysis is a robust nonparametric alternative to likelihood and least squares analysis. We propose an R package that calculates rank-based statistical analyses for twoand three-level random effects nested designs. In this package, a new algorithm which recursively obtains robust predictions for both scale and random effects is used, along with three rank-based fitting methods.",

This article covers methods, implemented in the MBmca package, for DNA Melting Curve Analysis on microbead surfaces. Particularly, the use of the second derivative melting peaks is suggested as an additional parameter to characterize the melting behavior of DNA duplexes.

    "description": "Comparing two proportions through the difference is a basic problem in statistics and has applications in many fields. More than twenty confidence intervals (Newcombe, 1998a,b) have been proposed. Most of them are approximate intervals with an asymptotic infimum coverage probability much less than the nominal level. In addition, large sample may be costly in practice. So exact optimal confidence intervals become critical for drawing valid statistical inference with accuracy and precision. Recently, Wang (2010, 2012) derived the exact smallest (optimal) one-sided 1 − α confidence intervals for the difference of two paired or independent proportions. His intervals, however, are computer-intensive by nature. In this article, we provide an R package ExactCIdiff to implement the intervals when the sample size is not large. This would be the first available package in R to calculate the exact confidence intervals for the difference of proportions. Exact two-sided 1 − α interval can be easily obtained by taking the intersection of the lower and upper one-sided 1 − α/2 intervals. Readers may jump to Examples 1 and 2 to obtain these intervals.",

Software packages that interpret the BUGS language include OpenBUGS, WinBUGS, and JAGS. R packages that link BUGS software to the R environment, including rjags and R2WinBUGS, are widely used in Bayesian analysis. Indeed, many packages in the Bayesian task view on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html) depend on this integration. However, the R and BUGS languages use different representations of common probability density functions, creating a potential for errors to occur in the implementation or interpre tation of analyses that use both languages. Here we review different parameterizations used by the R and BUGS languages, describe how to translate between the languages, and provide an R function, r2bugs.distributions, that transforms parameterizations from R to BUGS and back again.",

R packages for different stochastic methods such as genetic algorithms and differential evolution have been developed and successfully used in the R community. Based on Tsallis statistics, the R package GenSA was developed for generalized simulated annealing to process complicated non-linear objective functions with a large number of local minima. In this paper we provide a brief introduction to the R package and demonstrate its utility by solving a non-convex portfolio optimization problem in finance and the Thomson problem in physics. GenSA is useful and can serve as a complementary tool to, rather than a replacement for, other widely used R packages for optimization.",

    "description": "We present multiple factor analysis for contingency tables (MFACT) and its implementation in the FactoMineR package. This method, through an option of the MFA function, allows us to deal with multiple contingency or frequency tables, in addition to the categorical and quantitative multiple tables already considered in previous versions of the package. Thanks to this revised function, either a multiple contingency table or a mixed multiple table integrating quantitative, categorical and frequency data can be tackled. The FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008; Husson et al., 2011) offers the most commonly used principal component methods: principal component analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA; Benzécri, 1973), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA; Lebart et al., 2006) and multiple factor analysis (MFA; Escofier and Pagès, 2008). Detailed presentations of these methods enriched by numerous examples can be consulted at the website http://factominer.free.fr/. An extension of the MFA function that considers contingency or frequency tables as proposed by Bécue-Bertaut and Pagès (2004, 2008) is detailed in this article. First, an example is presented in order to motivate the approach. Next, the mortality data used to illustrate the method are introduced. Then we briefly describe multiple factor analysis (MFA) and present the principles of its extension to contingency tables. A real example on mortality data illustrates the handling of the MFA function to analyse these multiple tables and, finally, conclusions are presented.",

    "description": "Recent advances in computer recording and storing technology have tremendously increased the presence of functional data, whose graphical representation can be infinite-dimensional curve, image, or shape. When the same functional object is observed over a period of time, such data are known as functional time series. This article makes first attempt to describe several techniques (centered around functional principal component analysis) for modeling and forecasting functional time series from a computational aspect, using a readily-available R addon package. These methods are demonstrated using age-specific Australian fertility rate data from 1921 to 2006, and monthly sea surface temperature data from January 1950 to December 2011.",

    "description": "Blind people have experienced access issues to many software applications since the advent of the Windows operating system; statistical software has proven to follow the rule and not be an exception. The ability to use R within minutes of download with next to no adaptation has opened doors for accessible production of statistical analyses for this author (himself blind) and blind students around the world. This article shows how little is required to make R the most accessible statistical software available today. There is any number of ramifications that this opportunity creates for blind students, especially in terms of their future research and employment prospects. There is potential for making R even better for blind users. The extensibility of R makes this possible through added functionality being made available in an add-on package called BrailleR. Functions in this package are intended to make graphical information available in text form.",

    "title": "stellaR: A Package to Manage Stellar Evolution Tracks and Isochrones",
    "description": "We present the R package stellaR, which is designed to access and manipulate publicly available stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones from the Pisa low-mass database. The procedures for extracting important stages in the evolution of a star from the database, for constructing isochrones from stellar tracks and for interpolating among tracks are discussed and demonstrated. Due to the advance in the instrumentation, nowadays astronomers can deal with a huge amount of high-quality observational data. In the last decade impressive improvements of spectroscopic and photometric observational capabilities made available data which stimulated the research in the glob ular clusters field. The theoretical effort of recovering the evolutionary history of the clusters benefits from the computation of extensive databases of stellar tracks and isochrones, such as Pietrinferni et al. (2006); Dotter et al. (2008); Bertelli et al. (2008). We recently computed a large data set of stellar tracks and isochrones, “The Pisa low-mass database” (Dell’Omodarme et al., 2012), with up to date physical and chemical inputs, and made available all the calculations to the astrophysical community at the Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS)1 , a data center dedicated to the collection and worldwide distribution of astronomical data. In most databases, the management of the information and the extraction of the relevant evolu tionary properties from libraries of tracks and/or isochrones is the responsibility of the end users. Due to its extensive capabilities of data manipulation and analysis, however, R is an ideal choice for these tasks. Nevertheless R is not yet well known in astrophysics; up to December 2012 only seven astronomical or astrophysical-oriented packages have been published on CRAN (see the CRAN Task View Chemometrics and Computational Physics). The package stellaR (Dell’Omodarme and Valle, 2012) is an effort to make available to the astro physical community a basic tool set with the following capabilities: retrieve the required calculations from CDS; plot the information in a suitable form; construct by interpolation tracks or isochrones of compositions different to the ones available in the database; construct isochrones for age not included in the database; extract relevant evolutionary points from tracks or isochrones.",

Sometimes graphics show information models miss, sometimes graphics help to make model results more understandable, and sometimes models show whether information from graphics has statistical support or not. It is the interplay of the two approaches that is valuable. Graphics could be used a lot more in R examples and we explore this idea with some datasets available in R packages.",

We provide a package, geeM, which is implemented entirely in R and allows for user specified link and variance functions. The sparse matrix representations provided in the Matrix package enable a fast implementation. To gain speed, we make use of analytic inverses of the working correlation when possible and a trick to find quick numeric inverses when an analytic inverse is not available. Through three examples, we demonstrate the speed of geeM, which is not much worse than C implementations like geepack and gee on small data sets and faster on large data sets.",

    "title": "Possible Directions for Improving Dependency Versioning in R",
    "description": "One of the most powerful features of R is its infrastructure for contributed code. The built-in package manager and complementary repositories provide a great system for development and exchange of code, and have played an important role in the growth of the platform towards the de-facto standard in statistical computing that it is today. However, the number of packages on CRAN and other repositories has increased beyond what might have been foreseen, and is revealing some limitations of the current design. One such problem is the general lack of dependency versioning in the infrastructure. This paper explores this problem in greater detail, and suggests approaches taken by other open source communities that might work for R as well. Three use cases are defined that exemplify the issue, and illustrate how improving this aspect of package management could increase reliability while supporting further growth of the R community.",
