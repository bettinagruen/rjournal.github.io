<h1>Are you interested in becoming a reviewer?</h1>

Do you have experience developing software systems in R? Are you interested in 
contributing to the R community by refereeing journals, providing 
suggestions, and lending your perspective? If so, please consider volunteering
as a reviewer for the <i>R Journal</i>. We'll need your contact information and
areas of expertise. When we receive a submission in your area of research, 
we'll send you a manuscript for review.
