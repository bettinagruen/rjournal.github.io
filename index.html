<h1>The R Journal</h1><em>The R Journal</em> is the open access, refereed journal of the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_top">R project</a> for statistical computing. It features short to medium length articles covering topics that should be of interest to users or developers of R.

<p><em>The R Journal</em> intends to reach a wide audience and have a thorough review process. Papers are expected to be reasonably short, clearly written, not too technical, and of course focused on R. Authors of refereed articles should take care to:

<ul>
  <li>put their contribution in context, in particular discuss related R functions or packages;</li>

  <li>explain the motivation for their contribution;</li>

  <li>provide code examples that are reproducible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following revision of the content description of <em>The R Journal</em>, from January 2017 submitted articles may include:</p>

<dl class="inline">
  
  <dt>Reviews and proposals:</dt>
  
  <dd>surveying and discussing challenges and opportunities of potential importance for the broader R community, including proposals and proof-of-concept implementations.</dd>
  
  <dt>Comparisons and benchmarking:</dt>
  
  <dd>of implementations in base-R and contributed packages with each other, and where relevant with implementations in other software systems.</dd>
  
  <dt>Applications:</dt>

  <dd>demonstrating how new or existing techniques can be applied in an area of current interest using R, providing a fresh view of such analyses in R that is of benefit beyond the specific application.</dd>

  <dt>Add-on packages:</dt>

  <dd>short introductions to contributed R packages that are already available on CRAN or Bioconductor, and going beyond package vignettes in aiming to provide broader context and to attract a wider readership than package users. Authors need to make a strong case for such introductions, based for example on novelty in implementation and use of R, or the introduction of new data structures representing general architectures that invite re-use.</dd>
