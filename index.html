<h1>About The R Journal</h1><em>The R Journal</em> is the open access, refereed journal of the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_top">R project</a> for statistical computing.

  <li>put their contribution in context, in particular discuss related R functions or packages;</li>

  <li>explain the motivation for their contribution;</li>

  <li>provide code examples that are reproducible.</li>
</ul>
